Many strange legends are told of these jungles of India, but none so strange as the story of a small boy named Mowgli.
It all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound.
It was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle.
It was a man cub!
Had I known how deeply I was to be involved,
I would've obeyed my first impulse and walked away.
This man cub would have to have nourishment, and soon.
It was many days' travel to the nearest man-village, and without a mother's care, he would soon perish.
Then it occurred to me.
A family of wolves I knew had been blessed with a litter of cubs.
I knew there'd be no problem with the mother, thanks to the maternal instinct, but I wasn't so sure about Rama, the father.
Ten times, the rains had come and gone, and I often stopped by to see how Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.
He was a favourite with all the young wolf cubs of the pack.
No man cub was ever happier.
And yet, I knew that someday he would have to go back to his own kind.
Then one night, the wolf pack elders met at Council Rock because Shere Khan, the tiger, had returned to their part of the jungle.
This meeting was to change the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.
Rama.
Come over here, please.
Yes, Akela?
The council has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.
He must leave at once.
"Leave"?
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.
But the man cub is...
Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.
But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.
Akela, perhaps I can be of help.
You, Bagheera?
How?
I know of a man-village where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together.
I'm sure he'll go with me.
So be it.
Now there's no time to lose.
Good luck.
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle and he has sworn to kill you.
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?
He hates man.
Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man, just another hunter with a gun.
We'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense.
No one explains anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so, but I'm not afraid.
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.
Man Cub?
Man Cub!
Now, come on.
Up this tree.
It's safer up there.
I don't wanna go back to the man-village.
Go on.
Up you go.
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.
Is that all the better you can climb?
It's too big around.
And besides, I don't have any claws.
Now get some sleep.
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.
I wanna stay in the jungle.
You wouldn't last one day.
I'm not afraid.
I can look out for myself.
Say, now.
What have we here?
It's a man cub.
A delicious man cub.
Go away and leave me alone.
That's just what I should do, but I'm not.
Now, please go to sleep, Man Cub.
Yes, Man Cub.
Please go to sleep
Please go to sleep
Sleep, little man cub
Rest in peace
Sleep.
Sleep.
Bagheera...
Now, look, there's no use arguing any more.
Now, no more talk till morning.
He won't be here in the morning.
Yes, he will.
I...
Kaa!
Hold it, Kaa!
My sinus.
You have just made a serious mistake, my friend, a very stupid...
Now, Kaa, I was mistake.
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.
No, please, Kaa...
Both eyes, if you please.
You have just sealed your doom.
Look, Bagheera.
Look.
Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.
Wha...
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.
Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot in his tail."
This is going to slow down my slithering.
So, you can look out for yourself, can you?
So, you want to stay in the jungle, do you?
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.
Now, now, for the last time, go to sleep.
Man cub.
Man cub.
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up Two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
A parade!
No.
The dawn patrol again.
Company, sound off!
The aim of our patrol
Is a question rather droll
For to march and drill over field and hill
Is a military goal
Is a military goal
Hup, two, three, four
Dress it up, two, three, four
By the ranks or single file
Over every jungle mile
We stamp and crush through the underbrush
In the military style
In the military style
Hello.
What are you doing?
Drilling.
- Can I do it, too?
- Sure.
Just do what I do.
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.
To the rear, march!
The other way.
Turn around.
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up, two, three, four
To the rear...
Company, halt!
That means "stop."
Company, left face!
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd.
Silence in the ranks!
Dress up that line.
Pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection...
Arms!
Stick your nose out.
- Like this?
- That's right.
A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember, in battle, that trunk can save your life.
Take good care of it, my man.
- Yes, sir.
- Very good.
Carry on.
Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets.
Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.
Back in '88, it was...
Or...
Or was it?
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received the Victoria Cross, for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.
Those were the days.
Discipline!
Discipline was the thing.
Builds character and that sort of thing, you know.
Where was I?
Yes.
Inspection.
Well, very good.
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.
Eyes front.
Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?
There.
That's better.
And as for you...
There you are.
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?
Okay, Pop.
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh?
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!
Stop that!
A man cub!
This is treason!
Sabotage!
I'll have no man cub in my jungle!
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it!
Hold it!
I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.
Yes, yes.
Colonel Hathi.
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.
Good.
And remember, an elephant never forgets.
I don't know what the army's coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?
Let's get on with it!
Right face!
Forward march!
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.
An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just forgot our son.
Our...
Son?
Son!
Yes, yes, yes.
Quite right.
To the rear, march!
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times...
Pop!
Look out!
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."
He said an elephant never forgets.
It's not funny.
Let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.
Bagheera!
Where are we goin'?
You're going back to the man-village right now.
I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.
You're going, if I have to drag you every step of the way.
Let go, you...
You let go of me!
That does it.
I've had it, Man Cub.
From now on, you're on your own...
Alone!
Don't worry about me.
Foolish man cub.
Doo-bee, doo-bee Doo-bee-dee-doo
Well, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
Yes, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
I mean, a-doo-bee, doo-bee Doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee-dee-doo
And with...
Well, now.
What have we here?
Hey!
What a funny little bit of a...
Go away!
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.
What have I run on?
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.
Well, now, that's pretty big talk, Little Britches.
I'm big enough.
Pitiful.
Hey, kid, you need help and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.
Come on.
I'm gonna show ya.
Yeah!
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little.
Now, move.
That's it.
Now give me a big bear growl.
Scare me.
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.
He's in trouble.
I shouldn't have left him alone.
- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that?
You're gettin' it, kid.
Oh, no!
It's Baloo!
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.
Weave about now.
Look for an opening.
Keep movin'.
Keep...
You're gettin' it, kid. Come on!
That's it!
He's a dandy!
Fine teacher you are, Ol' Iron Paws.
Thanks, Bagheera.
Tell me, tell me, after you knock your pupil senseless, how do you expect him to remember the lesson?
Well, I...
I...
Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt.
I'm all right.
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.
You better believe it.
Now, let's go once more.
I want you to keep circling', or I'm gonna knock your roof in again.
You'd better keep movin'...
Hey!
Right on the button.
No. No, no. No, no.
Now you're tickling'.
No. No, now, we don't do that here in the...
No!
No, you're tickling'.
I can't stand that tickling'.
Help!
Bagheera!
Oh, boy.
That's all he needs, more confidence.
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!
I give...
Hey!
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.
What do they call you?
Mowgli, and he's going back to the man-village right now.
Man-village?
They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.
Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.
Certainly, you do.
And just how do you think he will survive?
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.
That shouldn't take too long.
Look, now, it's like this, Little Britches.
All you gotta do is...
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean, the bare necessities
Are Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare necessities of life
Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few
You eat ants?
You better believe it.
And you're gonna love the way they tickle.
Mowgli, look out!
The bare necessities of life will come to you
But when?
They'll come to you
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean, the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
Now, when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw Well, next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear try to use the claw But you don't need to use the claw When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue?
Golly, thanks, Baloo.
"Pawpaw." Of all the silly gibberish.
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat.
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to me!
They'll come to you
How 'bout scratching' that left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?
No. Just a hair lower.
There.
Right there.
That's it.
This is beautiful.
That's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratching'.
You're lots of fun, Baloo.
Right on it.
Yeah!
That's delicious.
Just a little bit...
Yeah!
Yeah!
Man.
This is really livin'.
So just try and relax.
Yeah.
Cool it.
Fall apart in my backyard.
'Cause let me tell you somethin', Little Britches...
If you act like that bee...
You're workin' too hard.
And don't spend your time lookin' around for something you want that can't be found.
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you somethin' true
The bare necessities of life will come to you
I give up.
Well, I hope his luck holds out.
Mowgli, how about you singin'?
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
Yeah, man!
I mean, the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah!
With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah, man
Beautiful.
That's real jungle harmony.
I like being a bear.
That's my boy.
You're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.
Yeah.
Doo-bee-doo
Doo-bee-doo
Aye-bee doogie-woogie doo
Hey, Mowgli, how about you flicking' that ol' mean fly off of your papa bear's nose?
Boy, when you flick a fly, you really...
Why, you flat-nosed, little-eyed, flaky creep!
Hey!
Let go of me!
Take your flea-pickin' hands off of my cub!
Come on and get 'im, champ!
- He ain't no champ!
He's a chump!
- Baloo!
Yeah!
A big hothead!
Okay, you guys asked for it.
I'll...
That'll cool 'im off!
Gimme back my man cub!
Here he is!
Come and get 'im!
That's how a bear can rest at ease!
Here's some bare necessities!
Now, just try that again, you...
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity!
You turn him loose, or I'll jerk a knot in your tail!
We give up!
Here he comes!
Baloo!
Catch me!
- Baloo!
- Back up!
Back up!
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
A rolling bear gathers no hair!
Baloo, help me!
Baloo!
They're carrying me away!
Bagheera!
Bagheera!
Well, it's happened.
Took a little longer than I thought, but it's happened.
Bagheera!
You heard me, huh?
Mowgli.
Mowgli!
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?
They ambushed me.
Thousands of 'em.
I jabbed with my left, then I swung with a right...
For the last time, what happened to Mowgli?
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys carried him off!
The ancient ruins.
I hate to think what will happen when he meets that king of theirs.
Dah dee-ding dah-ding-ding
Lode diddly-ohh-zing-boing
Sca-bee-doo, hoo-bi-dee Zee-boh-doh-zub
Diddly-ub-doo-dee-moy
I wanna be a man-man Mon-mon, lorang
Orangutango-jango
We got him, King Louie!
Here he is!
Man, we got him!
We got him!
So, you're the man cub.
Crazy!
I'm not as crazy as you are.
Put me down!
You cut that out!
Cool it, boy.
Unwind yourself.
Doo-doo doo-doo-doo, dee Doo-doo dee-doo-doo-doo-dee
Now, come on.
Let's shake, cousin.
What do you want me for?
Word has grabbed my royal ear...
Have a banana.
...that you wanna stay in the jungle.
"Stay in the jungle"?
I sure do.
Good.
And ol' King Louie...
Bah-be-do-bay Bu-bu-doo
That's me.
...can fix it for you.
Have two bananas.
Have we got a deal?
Yes, sir, I'll do...
I'll do anything to stay in the jungle.
Well, then,
I'll lay it on the line for you.
A-baba-beep-boop Boop-ee-doop
Now, I'm the king of the swingers
The jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what's been botherin' me
I wanna be a man, Man Cub and stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeying' around
- Ooh-be-doo
- Oop-dee-wee
- I wanna be like you
- Hop-dee-doo-bee-do-bow
I wanna walk like you Talk like you
- Too - Wee-bee-dee-bee-dee-boo

- An ape like me - Scooby-doo-bee-doo-bee
Can learn to be
Human, too
Wha...
Gee, Cousin Louie, you're doin' real good.
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz.
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire.
But I don't know how to make fire.
Now, don't try to kid me, Man Cub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Now give me the secret, Man Cub
Come on Clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you
Fire?
So that's what that scoundrel's after.
I'll tear 'im limb from limb.
I'll beat 'im.
I'll...
I'll...
Yeah!
Well, man, what a beat.
Will you stop that silly beat business and listen?
This will take brains, not brawn.
You better believe it, and I'm loaded with both.
- Will you listen?
- Yeah, yeah.
Now, while you create a disturbance, I'll rescue Mowgli.
- Got that?
- I'm gone, man.
- Solid gone!
- Not yet, Baloo!
Hey, de-zop-ba-nonie
Hap-de-dee-ba-lat Da-dat-dat-non
Hey, a-baby-dot-doo Zaba-doo-doo-day-doo-bop
Doo-boo-doo-day, ze-bonz Za-bop-bop-bobby
- Za-bah-doo-dee
- Well, a-ree-bah-naza
- He-beh-do-beh-doy
- Well, a-lah-bah-zini
- Wadahlabat-boodalabat
- Seebahlalat-dodie
- Oooh-ooh-ooh

One more time
Yeah!
Can learn to be like someone like me
Man!
- It's Baloo, the bear!
- Yeah, that's him!
How'd that square get in there?
Baloo!
It's you!
Man, that's what I call a swingin' party!
And furthermore, Baloo,
Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble, and your influence hasn't been exactly...
Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.
Well, he's had a big day.
It was a real sockeroo.
You know, it ain't easy learning' to be like me.
A disgraceful performance.
Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes?
I hope Mowgli learned something from that experience.
Scooby-dooby-dooby Dooby-doo
That's my boy.
Nonsense.
Baloo.
Over here.
I'd like to have a word with you.
"A word"?
You gonna talk some more?
All right, what's up, Bagheera?
Baloo, the man cub must go back to the man-village.
The jungle is not the place for him.
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.
Yes, just look at yourself.
Look at that eye.
Yeah.
It's beautiful, ain't it?
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket of fruit yourself.
Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.
Why not?
How can I put it?
Baloo, birds of a feather should flock together.
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?
I don't know.
Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.
Baloo, you've got to be serious about this.
Stop worrying', Baggy.
Stop worrying'.
I'll take care of him.
Yes, like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.
And another thing, sooner or later Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.
The tiger?
What's he got against the kid?
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.
But little Mowgli don't have those things.
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.
Just one swipe and...
Well, what are we gonna do?
We'll do what's best for the boy.
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.
Good.
Then make Mowgli go to the man-village.
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him he could stay here in the jungle with me.
That's just the point.
As long as he remains with you, he's in danger.
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?
Because he won't listen to me.
I love that kid.
I love him like he was my own cub.
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.
Well, can't I wait until morning?
It's morning now.
Go on, Baloo.
Oh, boy.
Mowgli.
Mowgli.
It's time to get up.
Hi, Baloo.
Hi.
Hey, rub that ol' sleep outta your eyes.
You and me, we got a long walk ahead of us.
Swell.
Gee, we'll have lots of fun together.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, let's hit the trail, kid.
See ya around, Bagheera.
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.
Me and Baloo, we've got things to do.
Goodbye, Man Cub, and good luck.
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is...
Look for the bare necessities
Some good ol' bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean, the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah!
I'll live here in the jungle all my life
Yeah, man!
I like being a bear.
Where we goin', Baloo?
Well, it's...
Well, it's sorta new and...
I don't care, as long as I'm with you.
Mowgli, look, buddy, there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.
Tell me what, Baloo?
Gee whiz.
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's...
Mowgli...
You wouldn't marry a panther, would ya?
Gee, I don't even know what you're talking about.
Mowgli, don't you realise that you're a human?
I'm not any more, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!
Mowgli, stop it now.
Hold still.
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin' all morning to tell ya,
I've got to take you back to the man-village.
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!
That's goin' too far!
Hey, Mowgli!
Where you goin'?
Wait a minute!
Stop!
Wait!
Wait!
Listen to ol' Baloo!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli.
Mowgli!
Now what's happened?
Well, you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera, but look, now, I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me!
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's separate.
We've got to find him!
If anything happens to that little guy, I'll never forgive myself.
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Hup, two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up, two, three, four
What beastly luck.
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.
Company, sound off!
We march from here to there
And it doesn't matter where
You can hear us push through the deepest bush
Hup, two, three, four
With a military air
With a military air
The jungle patrol!
We're a crackerjack brigade
On a pachyderm parade
But we'd rather stroll to a water hole
Hup, two, three, four
For a furlough in the shade
Stop!
Wait a minute.
Halt!
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.
Well, speak up.
Who was it?
It was me, Colonel.
What do you mean, sir, taking over my command?
Highly irregular, you know.
Colonel, I'm sorry, but I need your help.
Absolutely impossible.
We're on a cross-country march.
But it's an emergency, Colonel.
- The man cub must be found.
- Man cub?
What man cub?
How interesting.
The one I was taking to the man-village.
Good.
That's where he belongs.
Now, sir, if you don't mind, we'd like to get on with the march.
No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.
He is lost.
He ran away.
How delightful.
Well, it serves the young whippersnapper right.
But Shere Khan, the tiger, is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.
Shere Khan.
Nonsense, old boy.
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here.
Sorry, Bagheera.
Fortunes of war and all that sort of thing, you know.
This has gone far enough.
Far enough!
Now, just a minute, you pompous old windbag!
Winifred!
What are you doing out of ranks?
Never mind.
How would you like to have our boy lost and alone in the jungle?
Our son, alone?
But, Winifred, old girl, that's an entirely different matter.
Different, entirely.
That little boy is no different than our own son.
Now you help find him or I'm taking over command.
What?
A female leading my herd?
Utterly preposterous.
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.
Please, Pop, sir?
Please?
Now, don't you worry, son.
Your father had a plan in mind all the time.
Sure you did.
Troopers!
Company, left face!
Volunteers for a special mission will step one pace forward.
That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub.
Thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.
Yes.
Yes.
Bugler, when the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet three times.
Yes, sir.
Not now, soldier.
Sorry, sir.
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be the element of surprise.
You will take one squad and cover the right flank.
Yes, sir.
And I shall meet the other squad on the left flank.
Very well.
Company...
Forward march!
Element of surprise?
I say.
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub.
Kaa!
It's you!
Yes, Man Cub.
So nice to see you again.
Go away.
Leave me alone.
Let me look at you.
You don't want me to look at you?
Then you look at me.
No, sir.
I know what you're trying to do, Kaa.
You do?
I mean, you don't trust me.
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.
You want to help me?
Certainly.
I can see to it that you never have to leave this jungle.
How could you do that?
I have my own subtle little ways.
But first, you must trust me.
I don't trust anyone any more.
I don't blame you.
I'm not like those so-called fair-weather friends of yours.
You can believe in me.
Trust in me
Just in me
Shut your eyes
And trust in me
Hold still, please.
You can sleep
Safe and sound
Knowing I
Am around
Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely
Your senses will cease to resist
You're snoring.
Sorry.
Trust in me
And just in me
Shut your eyes
And trust in me
Now what?
I'll be right down.
Yes?
Yes?
Who is it?
It's me, Shere Khan.
I'd like a word with you, if you don't mind.
Shere Khan.
What a surprise.
Yes, isn't it?
I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.
No, no.
Nothing at all.
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils.
Coils?
Someone?
No.
I was just curling up for my siesta.
But you were singing to someone.
- Who is it, Kaa?
- Who?
No.
I was just singing to myself.
Indeed.
Yes.
Yes, you see, I have trouble with my sinuses.
- What a pity.
- You have no idea.
It's simply terrible.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep, so I sing myself to sleep.
You know, self-hypnosis?
Let me show you how it works.
Trust in me
I can't be bothered with that.
I have no time for that sort of nonsense.
- Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.
But at the moment I am searching for a man cub.
"Man cub"?
What man cub?
The one who's lost.
Now, where do you suppose he could be?
Search me.
That's an excellent idea.
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?
Certainly not.
Nothing here, and nothing in here.
My sinuses.
Indeed.
And now, how about the middle?
The middle?
The middle.
Absolutely nothing in the middle.
Really?
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub, you will inform me first.
- Understand?
- I get the point.
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.
And I must continue my search for the helpless little lad.
Who does he think he's fooling?
"Helpless little lad."
He gives me the shivers.
Picking on that poor little helpless boy.
Yes.
The poor little helpless boy.
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.
It's like you said.
You can't trust anyone.
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again, it will be too soon.
My sacroiliac.
Hey, Flaps.
What we gonna do?
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?
I've got it!
Let's flap over to the east side of the jungle.
They've always got a bit of action, a bit of a swingin' scene.
Come off it!
Things are right dead all over.
You mean you wish they were.
Very funny.
Okay, so what we gonna do?
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?
Look, Flaps, first I say, "What we gonna do?"
Then you say, "I don't know. What do you wanna do?"
"What we gonna do?" "What you wanna do?"
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!
Okay.
What do you want to do?
Blimey.
There you go again.
The same notes again.
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?
Hold it, lads. Look.
Look what's coming our way.
Hey, what in the world is that?
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.
Yeah, and they're all walking about by themselves.
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again.
Come on, lads.
Come on.
Let's have some fun with this little fella, this Little Bloke, eh?
Blimey!
He's got legs like a stork, he has.
Like a stork.
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.
Go ahead.
Laugh.
I don't care.
What's wrong with him?
I think we overdid it.
We were just having a bit of fun, that's all.
Just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.
You know, he must be down on his luck.
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood.
Hey, new kid!
Wait a minute!
Hey!
Just leave me alone.
Come on.
What's wrong?
You look like you haven't got a friend in the world.
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?
No. Nobody wants me around.
Yeah.
We know how you feel.
Nobody wants us around either.
We may look a bit shabby, but we've got hearts.
And feelings, too.
And just to prove it to you, we're going to let you join our little group.
Kid, we'd like to make you an honorary vulture.
Thanks, but I'd rather be on my own alone.
Now, look, kid.
Everybody's got to have friends.
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?
We're your friends
We're your friends
We're your friends to the bitter end
The bitter end
When you're alone
When you're alone
Who comes around
Who comes around
To pluck you up
Give us a smile.
To pluck you up
When you are down
When you are down
And when you're outside looking in
Who's there to open the door?
Come on, kid.
We need a tenor.
That's
What
Friends are for
Who's always eager to extend
A friendly claw
That's what friends are for
And when you're lost
In dire need
Who's at your side
At lightning speed
We're friends with every creature comin' down the pike
In fact, we've never met an animal we didn't like
You take it, kid.
Didn't like
- So, you can see we're friends - Friends in need
We're friends in need and friends indeed
Friends indeed
Friends indeed
Easy, lads.
Steady.
Watch it!
We'll keep you safe in the jungle
Forevermore
That's what friends
Are for
Bravo.
Bravo.
An extraordinary performance.
And thank you for detaining my victim.
Don't mention it, Your Highness.
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room!
Gangway!
Run, friend!
Run!
"Run"?
Why should I run?
Why should you run?
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am?
I know you, all right.
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.
Then you should also know that everyone runs from Shere Khan.
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.
You have spirit for one so small, and such spirit is deserving of a sporting chance.
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten.
It makes the chase more interesting...
For me.
One, two, three,
four...
You're trying my patience.
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Run, Mowgli, run!
Let go, you big oaf!
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Slow!
Easy, now!
Easy!
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.
And he better hang on, too.
Take that, you big bully.
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid!
Go on!
Baloo!
Help me!
Somebody do something with that kid!
Come on, lads!
He's safe now!
You can let go, Baloo.
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.
I'll kill you for this.
Let go!
Baloo needs help!
Fire!
That's the only thing Old Stripes is afraid of.
You get the fire.
We'll do the rest.
Charge!
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!
Yeah, yeah.
Missed me a mile, he did!
Yeah, pull his blinking' whiskers!
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!
Look behind you, chum.
Well, that's the last of him.
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did.
Well, come on.
Let's go congratulate our friend.
Hold it, fellas.
Now is not the time for it.
Look.
Baloo?
Baloo, get up.
Please, get up.
Mowgli, try to understand.
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was.
You...
You don't mean...
No. Baloo.
Now, now.
I know how you feel.
But you must remember, Mowgli,
"Greater love hath no one
"than he who lays down his life for his friend."
When great deeds are remembered in this jungle, one name will stand above all others.
Our friend, Baloo the bear. He's crackin' me up.
The memory of Baloo's sacrifice and bravery will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts.
Beautiful. This spot where Baloo fell will always be a hallowed place in the jungle, for there lies one of nature's noblest creatures.
I wish my mother could have heard this.
It's best we leave now.
Come along, Man Cub.
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!
There's more.
Lots more!
Why, you big fraud!
You four-flusher!
I'm fed up!
Baloo, you're all right!
Who, me?
Sure I am.
Never felt...
Better.
- You sure had us worried.
- I was just takin' five.
You know, playin' it cool.
- But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.
It's going to be a bit dull without the Little Bloke, isn't it?
Yeah.
So what we gonna do?
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!
Hey, Baggy. Too bad you missed the action.
You should have seen how I made a sucker out of Old Stripes with that left up in his face.
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him.
"Wham!"
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.
- You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing or nobody is ever gonna come between us again.
My own home
My own home
My own home
My own home
Look!
What's that?
- It's the man-village.
- No, no.
I mean that.
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.
So you've seen one.
So let's go.
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Baloo.
Let him have a better look.
Father's hunting in the forest
Mother's cooking in the home
I must go to fetch the water
Till the day that I am grown
Till I'm grown
Till I'm grown
I must go to fetch the water Till the day that I am grown Then I will have a handsome husband
And a daughter of my own
And I'll send her to fetch the water
I'll be cooking in the home
Then I'll send her to fetch the water
I'll be cooking in my home
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.
Mowgli, come back.
Come back.
Go on.
Go on.
He's hooked.
It was inevitable, Baloo.
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.
Mowgli is where he belongs now.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
But I still think he'd have made one swell bear.
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.
Let's get back to where we belong.
And get with the beat.
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Are Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare necessities of life

It's your father.
There's been an accident.

Woman:
Dr. Carey's office.
It's Henry Oldfield.
I need to speak with her.
She's in a session right now.
Can I have her call you?
Please, please.
Driver:
Nothing like it, eh?
God's green earth.
"All creatures great and small."
There we go.
- Okay.
- This way.
This isn't gonna be like the salmon farm, is it, Grant?
Hey, those fish died free.
- Come on, possum.
- Shh shh.
What's that?
( engine roaring )
Angus fucking Oldfield.
( sheep bleating )
You'll wait for me, right?
It's your money.
( door closes )
Hello?
Hello?
Unless you fancy nostrils in the back of your head, I'd not be moving if I were you.
Mrs. Mac.
Bugger me days!
Henry!
Oh!
Oh.
( laughs )
Oh don't worry.
- l haven't shot anyone since Christmas.
- ( laughs )
Oh, just wait until your brother sees you.
Yeah.
The Merino, the Romney, the Drysdale-- these names are whispered in the winds that caress the rugged hills.
These names are shared in corners of the farmyard, and these are the names the young men of the land recite as they take themselves off at night.
But in the future, they will whisper just one name... the Oldfield.
Now you take it down and lead it round in front of the guests.
Stop so they can touch it, slap a flank, feel the wool.
I'll take the other microphone, give it to anyone else who... has a question.
Get a prospectus on every seat, then go up the hill and get the animal.
What are you doing here?
Lawyers have this under control, don't they?
What am I doing here?
Our family's been here for over 100 years.
Our father was born here.
Our mother died giving birth to me here.
This is where l spent the first 10 years of my life.
And my therapist said I should come.
( laughs ) Therapy.
- So you're still funny about the sheep.
- lt's not about the sheep.
It's about other issues I need to resolve.
Okay.
( bleats )
Angus.
Go inside.
I'll cut you a check.
Girl:
That must be the laboratory.
Woman:
Careful.
There you go.
- Okay.
- Astrid Rush.
Girl:
Who'd hire her after the thing with the leeches?
( shutter clicks )
- You're end?
- Come and give a hand here.
Rush:
Careful!
Grant!
- Up, up more...
- Shit.
Yeah, baby, yeah!
- Go after him!
- ( gasps )
Oi!
- Whooo!
- Hey wait!
They'll never catch us.
They're meat eaters.
( panting ) Okay.
- What was one, Grant?
- What?
Um, get in unobserved.
Right.
And what was two?
- Collect visual evidence.
- Right.
Three?
- Get out unobserved?
- Yeah.
And four?
Blow this whole fucking game wide open;
Take the bastard under and go down in history as the two people with enough balls to save this country from genetically- engineered devastation!
No, Grant.
Four was a have a meeting about what to do next.
This is evidence, okay?
It's evidence.
Actually, that's probably highly-toxic genetic material.
Fuckin' A!
( whispering ) Fuckin' A. And it's mine.
Or, it's ours.
You and me, baby, all the way.
Yeah, Grant.
About the you and me bit...
Now I wonder if our relationship hasn't kind of got--
Shh!
They're in here somewhere.
- Go!
- Grant, wait.
Man:
There he goes!
Oi!
- Whoa!
- ( glass shatters )
Over there!
Where is he?
- Bugger! - Grant:
Oh fuck.
( snarling )
( screams )
( Grant screaming )
( continues screaming )
( gurgling )
( screams )
Right.
That's for me.
And that's for you.
It'll buy you a lot of therapy.
Well, there's not much around here in the way of your cappuccino culture, but I'm sure Mrs. Mac will do you a cup of tea and an Anzac biscuit for the road.
That's it, then.
You got rid of all Dad's things.
Living in the past-- that's what's wrong with these bloody farmers.
You're now the owner of the biggest farm in the district.
What does that make you?
Up here's where the smart farming's done these days, Henry.
is that what all that outside's in aid of?
People are interested in what I'm doing here, Henry.
It's a whole new approach to farming.
It's better for the animals, better for the farmers, better for the consumer.
It's an exciting time to be in agricultural sciences.
And a profitable one.
( moaning )
More tea, Henry?
I think three's enough.
I should get going.
That's a pity.
I'm making watercress for the Japanese.
Look, chopsticks.
He's quite the lord of the manor now, isn't he?
Uh...
Angus was throwing this away.
I know your father would have wanted you to have it.
The Golden Shears.
Best shearer in the country three years running.
l-- l really can't see it on my coffee table.
You got what you came for then?
Angus has got his deal.
Guess I'm done here.
I'm having the farm manager take you for a run up to the top.
But I haven't been up there since the accident.
I know.
That's why you're going.
Oh, here he is now.
- Kia ora, Auntie.
- Henry:
Tucker.
( bleats )
( bleating )
( sniffing )
( growls )
Flash threads, bro.
So you a model now or something?
I'm doing l.T. Internet stuff.
Oh.
Nude modeling.
( laughs )
And you're manager now?
Well, your brother's hardly young farmer of the year, is he?
Angus seems to think he's got a handle on things.
The only thing he's got a handle on is his--
( brakes screech )
( honking )
Okay, farm boy, let's see your stuff.
Sure.
Okay.
Come on.
Yah!
What happened to you, darling?
Give us a hand, bro!
l-- l just need to make a phone call.
Jesus, man.
Just gonna shove her back over the fence.
( dialing )
( Henry moans )
Hey!
- Tucker:
Hands up?
- Hands up!
( whimpering )
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'll protect you.
( crunches )
Girl:
Grant!
Grant?
is this gonna take long?
Because I've got a taxi waiting.
If you fascists have hurt him, I will organize the biggest sit-in this farm has ever seen.
Look, we don't know where your friend is, okay?
- Maybe my brother could help?
- Brother?
Angus Oldfield.
I should have known you were an Oldfield.
I can see it in your aura.
I think that was just something he stepped in back there, eh?
- No, you have a very selfish aura.
- What?
How would you like a taste of what you're dishing out?
Safety's on.
- What?
- The safety's on.
Just... yeah, on the other side.
Back a bit.
And down.
Back and down.
Up.
Here here, here.
Yeah.
There we go, here.
Yeah, right.

( man screaming ) ...they were like, looking around at us and--
What about me?
Can we give you a ride somewhere?
Maybe to the car so I can, um...
Tucker:
Organize your sit-in?
Wait for my-- for Grant.
I'm Henry, this is Tucker.
What's your name?
- Experience.
- Has been so far.
( chuckles )
So why were you going to shoot me, Experience?
Because this farm subjects innocent animals to cruel and sadistic torture.
Because--
Smoke.
( dog barks )
- You coming?
- Um...
Mike?
Mike!
Oh my God.
What?
The feng shui in this room is terrible.
( rustling )
Anyone there?
Mike?
( hooves clopping )
Oh God.
( snarls )
Jesus, man, it's not gonna bite.
- What's it doing?
- What is wrong with you?
- Ovinophobia, my therapist calls it.
- What's that?
Just a completely unfounded and irrational fear that one day this is gonna happen!
Well, this happens when you run the most reckless genetic engineering program in the southern hemisphere.
- Who engineered that?
- Your brother.
( sheep banging )
( screams )
Mike.
- ( bleating ) - ( Experience screams )
Come on then, muttonchops!
Bugger me.
( groans )
- ( bleats )
- Shoot it again!
That'll give you something to talk to your therapist about.
Experience:
Oh, I'm going to be sick!
( sheep bleating )
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Kia ora.
Kia ora, kia ora.
Rattle your dags, Henry!
There we go.
Good girls.
They're fine.
Tucker:
You get Henry. I'll start the car.
God, your chi is in shambles.
Huh?
Take a deep breath.
You need to ground yourself.
You're a tree.
Come on.
A tree.
Your taproot extends down into the earth.
My-- my what?
That's your base chakra.
Feel the energy drawing out of the soil.
Can you feel it?
Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Come on, Henry.
The energy flows up into your navel chakra, your solar plexus chakra, into your heart chakra.
It spreads to your branches, your twigs, your leaves.
You are a mighty kauri commanding the forest.
Look with your third eye.
Totally relaxed.
Totally relaxed.
- ( honking )
- Get on the fucking truck!
- ( engine starts )
- Nearly there, nearly there.
- ( snarls ) - ( gasps )
Go!
Go go go!
Watch out for the sheep!
Shoot!
Sorry.
- ( grunts )
- What the hell's he doing?
( groaning )
Chainsaw.
( motor sputtering ) ls it turned on?
( groans )
- Prime it, prime it!
- What?
The pump thing.
- ( motor starts ) - ( screams )
( honking horn )
Fuck!
Oi, Henry!
- Are you okay?
- lf it weren't for my gumboot...
Who's driving?
- Jump!
- Both:
What?
Jump off, now!
Jump off!
Ah!
( bleats )
( bleating )
Oh, shit.
Experience:
Wow, what a beautiful view.
- This is, uh, where-- - l know.
This is what?
Ooh, long way down.
I wouldn't want to fall off there.
This is where my father fell to his death.
Oh.
Sorry... to hear that.
Oh, a sheep!
is that a good one or a bad one?
( farts )
Oh, definitely bad.
That's not funny.
Animal flatulence is responsible for almost half the world's greenhouse gas emissions.
It's pure methane.
The Kyoto Protocol--
Kyahhh!
What do we do?
Well, reducing carbon emission from industries--
No, what do we do about raising the alarm?
My phone... is in the truck.
Tucker, what do you think?
Hoof it for the house.
Tell his lordship what's going on.
is it far?
It's rough terrain, open paddocks, hot day, no cover.
Yeah, I'd say it's pretty far.
With about 50,000 sheep in between.
Then what?
Then I get as far away from here as I can.
You're still leaving?
I'm especially leaving.
Experience:
Oh, what if the sheep get down there before us?
Then Angus is gonna have some unexpected visitors.
( snoring )
Henry.
Well?
No sign of him.
The others have gone out into the paddocks.
You cannot make a cup of tea in this country without some do-gooder starting a petition to have you do it their way.
You help me in the lab.
And you, get rid of that stuff.
( barking )
Bloody animals.
- ( growling ) - ( screams )
( sniffing )
( honking )
You and your-- your bloody 4-wheel drives.
Think you own the road!
I do, actually.
Angus Oldfield.
What hole did you crawl out of?
WEKA.
The Whole Earth Kollective Aotearoa.
I know all about your Frankensheep!
Mother Nature spent millions of years making sheep.
She doesn't need your help!
Don't talk to me about nature.
Man made sheep what they are today, and I'm making them what they'll be tomorrow.
If I was a sheep, I wouldn't be anywhere near you!
If you were a sheep, I'd have you ground up for dog food, you little worm.
Now get the fuck off my land.
- ( growling )
- Ahh!
Henry:
They might come from anywhere.
And they might not.
Calm down, bro.
So this guy you're looking for, is he your boyfriend?
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.
- ls he your boyfriend?
- Grant's part of our collective.
We're a non-profit cooperative that shares information and resources about environmental issues.
So what were you and your boyfriend doing here today?
We keep hearing about some cowboy lab that's flushing every animal research guideline down the toilet.
Scum like Astrid Rush and your brother need to answer to somebody sometime.
For someone who likes animals, you don't like people very much, do you?
I would have thought that you of all people would appreciate efforts to deconstruct the colonialist paternalistic agrarian hierarchy that disenfranchises the Tangata Whenua and erodes the natural resources of Aotearoa.
Learn all that at university, did ya, before you dropped out?
I didn't drop out, thank you.
I just missed exams while we were occupying a poultry farm.
Anyway, that's none of your business.
- ( groans )
- Henry:
Are you okay?
Rescue Remedy?
I don't need rescuing.
I need Dettol and a sticking plaster.
No thanks.
Fine, suit yourself.
Henry:
Wait, we should stick together.
Tucker, I'm sorry.
It's my fault you got bitten.
Don't worry.
It'll be-- oh fuck!
I'll get a tetanus shot when we get back.
- Clear it right up.
- But the sheep did that.
Then I'll get the vet to have a look at it. lt'll be fine.
( bleating )
Oh God.
Here they come.
- Don't wait for me!
- l'm not leaving you behind.
- What about the sheep?
- Well, fuck the sheep!
No time for that, bro!
( panting ) - ln here. - Not in there.
Why not?
It's been here forever. lt's empty.
- No it's not, bro.
- This is your brother's laboratory.
( barks )
You got a better idea?
Go home.
Get, go on!
- ( barks )
- Henry:
Come on.
( lock clicks )
Did you know about this?
I just thought they were playing with sperm or something.
( beating )
Oh God.
( growls )
Stand back!
Do it.
Tucker?
Jesus, Henry, are you gonna shoot me if I end up like that?
- You're trespassing.
- Taihoa, Bo Peep.
What is this?
I told you.
agricultural science.
This isn't science.
The sheep are revolting.
Aren't they?
- Now, Henry...
- Hey hey.
I'll take that as your resignation.
Angus, what would Dad say about all this?
He wouldn't say anything.
He'd be knee-deep in mud with his hand up a sheep's ass.
Your father was 10 times the farmer you are.
My father fell off a cliff chasing a wool-blind ewe.
Angus, there's something wrong with the sheep.
They attacked us.
Oh nonsense.
Your brother's clearly one of these lunatic greenies.
Tucker, show them your foot.
Foot?
Henry, I simply won't allow you to disrupt things today.
What are you going to do about it, eh?
( Tucker groaning )
Whatever I have to.
Angus, are you nuts?
There's a lot riding on this, Henry. I told you, it's gonna be very profitable.
( groaning ) Henry, get out of here. Do something!
Get out of here!
- What?
- Move your ass!
- ( whimpering )
- Henry, come on!
Stop!
( bleating )
This way!
( Experience groans ) ln there!
Oh, what's down here?
Look at them, Angus!
Look at you.
The fifth generation farmer's son who's scared of a few sheep.
You do need therapy.
Ah!
There's no deal, Angus.
We have a contract, Henry.
It's done.
Not with all this going on.
( bleating )
- Ah!
- Henry!
Help me!
Help me, Angus!
Angus!
I'm your brother!
That's the thing about farms, Henry, accidents happen.
- Let me go.
- No. No.
( both shout )
( both grunt )
( panting, coughing )
Oh my God!
- Are you okay?
- l'll never be okay ever again.
- ( groans ) - ( zipper unzips )
( lighter strikes )
- What's that?
- Geranium-- aroma therapy for uplift and hormonal balance.
Do your hormones really need balancing?
Considering I've been attacked by genetically- engineered monsters, jumped off a moving vehicle, been chased across a paddock, dragged into a torture chamber, pulled into a mountain of rotting flesh-- yes, my hormones need fucking balancing.
- Working yet?
- Uplifting at any moment.
- Where are you going?
- There are caves near the woolshed.
If this is part of the same system, we can walk right under the sheep.
Right.
( sniffing )
All he had to do was leave.
Why wouldn't he do that?
What happened to those idiots I sent to collect you?
That looks...
anomalous.
What it looks like is the spontaneous cellular transferral we've been trying to achieve for months.
Or possibly not so spontaneous.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
He'll be out for a while.
Where's your brother and that girl?
Oh, don't worry.
They're gone.
Well, I don't know what they're on about.
The sheep?
Really.
There's too many people running around here today.
One of those greenies bit me on my way up the hill.
- Bit you?
- Yeah.
Looked like he hadn't bathed for months.
Hm, you may need a shot.
Well.
I want this place secured.
Yeah, I have something I need to observe here, but I'll be down presently.
No. Stay here.
Stay here?
I need to present my work.
Look, the last thing I need is someone with your reputation prancing about the place.
Oh, my reputation didn't seem to bother you when you needed someone to kick-start this venture.
Or when you wanted to pursue some personal interests.
( bleats ) I was just coming up with solutions that you hadn't thought of.
Now I'll send someone up for the animal.
You lock this place down and stay out of the way.
What about that shot?
Put a plaster on it.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
The amount of bad karma your brother's generating, he'll probably come back as a sheep.
I don't want to think about what Angus has been doing.
Using your father's legacy as a testing ground for vile experiments on animals.
Experience.
What was all that about a deal?
Huh?
What are you here for today?
I sold him my share of the farm.
I thought if I could come back here and resolve things with him, I could move on.
But these are your roots.
( lighter strikes )
There's something in here.
There can't be.
Or they'd have to...
- ( bleating, thumps ) - jump!
Come on!
Shit!
I have to get out of here!
- Down here.
- No. No way.
If it's a way out, we're there.
If it's not, we're there forever.
( bleating )
You go first!
Henry:
It shouldn't be too far.
Keep moving.
I can't.
You can.
Look, you're a tree.
- A tree.
- Feel your roots
- in the ground.
Feel your, um...
- Chakra.
- ...chakra...
- My base chakra.
...drawing energy from the ground.
Okay, I feel it.
There.
You're relaxed.
I'm relaxed.
- ( farts )
- Don't get too relaxed.
( growling )
Go!
Go!
- Hurry up!
- l'm hurrying!
( Henry grunts )
- Don't stop!
- lt's opening up!
- ( growling ) - ( Henry grunts )
I'm stuck!
( bleating )
- ( squealing ) - ( fire roaring )
I was wrong about your aura.
Really?
I said it was selfish, but... now I think it was something you stepped in.
( chuckles )
This way.
Mrs. Mac:
"Address To A Haggis:
Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,
Great chieftain o' the pudding-race!
Aboon them a' ye take your place,
Painch tripe or thairm."
- Oh hello, dear.
- ( gasps )
Did you see Henry up the hill?
Uh, no.
No, I think he's gone.
Oh?
Really?
I thought he would have at least said goodbye.
Well... you can't tell what Henry will do, can you?
It's all his bloody fault.
He had his money-- good money.
My money.
That little baaa-stard.
Henry:
Up here.
This is how I remember it.
It's beautiful.
We'd better hurry.
( water running )
( nozzle squeaks )
( light buzzing )
What's that noise?
Somebody shearing.
( animal panting )
- ( shears buzzing ) - ( panting )
Experience:
Hello?
( growling )
Oh God, no.
( sniffing )
Grant?
- ( growling )
- Oh!
( gasps )
What's happened to you?
Grant, it's me-- Experience.
- Hey!
- ( shears buzzing )
( roaring )
Experience:
Henry!
- ( Grant roaring )
- This way!
Come on!
Henry:
Round here.
- He's coming!
- Come on.
Oh shit!
Grant, what's that on your face?
is that blood?
( grunts )
Have you been eating meat, Grant?
Was it even organic?
( burps )
So, that's your boyfriend?
I knew you liked animals, but I didn't think you...
He's not my boyfriend.
Something must have bitten him.
You mean... like Tucker?
The amniotic fluid should work as an attenuated vaccine on the mutated cells.
What's going on?
- Tell me how you feel?
- Sore.
ltchy.
My-- my skin feels really tight.
- Go on.
- ( growls )
No no no no no no no no.
No, wait.
( groaning )
( people chatting )
All right, thanks very much.
Oh hello.
Thanks for coming.
Konnichiwa.
Angus:
We're about to kick off.
There's my girl.
( breathing heavy )
- ( growls ) - ( screams )
( growling )
- ( screams ) - ( laughs )
Oh shit!
Angus won't be selling much sheep if he turns into one, will he?
He might need that shot after all.
You're a very lucky young man, to be witness to a new scientific frontier.
I have a small errand to attend to, and then... I think we might try and replicate the effect on you with some of these cultures I have.
In the meantime, you rest up.
( footsteps recede )
( microphone feedback )
( microphone feedback )
Konnichiwa, güten tag, kia ora, g'day.
This land was carved from virgin bush by my great-great grandfather more than... 100 years ago.
My family have sowed their seed here since that time.
But now... I have a dream for the future--
- a dream of sheep.
- ( sheep bleats )
( chuckles )
( bleats )
Oh.
The Merino, the Romney, the Drysdale.
Excuse me.
( panting )
( bleating ) lt's not far.
It's just a quick trip through the trees.
( bleating )
( bleating )
( Rush screaming )
These names are shared in corners of the farm--
( bleating )
These-- these names are...
- names...
- ( bleating )
( murmuring )
Well, time to meet the star of our show, I suppose.
I give you the Oldfield.
Man:
It's beautiful.
( applause )
( bleats )
- Quiet down.
- ( bleating )
( whispering ) Ah, beautiful.
( bleating continues )
( audience laughing )
Quiet now.
Quiet, my pretty.
( low rumbling )
Oh no.
( people screaming )
Perhaps it won't be that bad.
( screaming )
Easy!
Easy!
Easy!
( woman screaming )
Oh!
( gurgling )
"Lo, on Mount Zion stood the lamb, and with him, 144,000."
( gasping )
( man screaming in Japanese )
( sniffing )
( bleating )
( screaming )
Woman:
But I'm a vegetarian!
Was, was, was!
"lt is these who follow the lamb wherever he goes, for they are spotless!"
- Help me!
Help me! - Ew!
Get off!
Help me!
( both speaking German )
Take me... ( honks )
Take me up, O Lord!
Henry!
Just in time for dinner!
- Oh my Lord!
- ( screaming )
Oh!
( bleats )
( laughing )
Yeah!
Angus:
Easy, easy.
That's my girl.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay. lt's okay.
There, it's-- l know.
It's okay, yes.
I know, it's okay.
Let's make that phone call.
I think MAF, then WEKA.
Or WEKA then MAF.
Someone must have one of the other phones off the hook.
- Who else is in the-- - ( growling )
- Your boyfriend's back.
- Experience:
Jesus, Grant.
- Henry!
- Ow!
Mrs. Mac:
My shotgun's in the pantry!
Many's the meal I've made of wethers like you.
- You don't scare me.
- ( roars )
- What is that?
- ( grunts )
- My haggis!
- ( slurping )
Shells!
( howling )
Shells!
No!
What did you do?
Ling gui ba fa.
- Huh?
- Acupuncture point.
Causes temporary paralysis.
Or coma if I did it wrong.
Did you?
He fell down, didn't he?
( sheep bleating )
( Experience struggling )
We're safe.
We're trapped.
Let's make that call.
Where's the other phone?
Uh, Angus's study.
- Locked!
- Here we are.
Angus:
You're alive.
I pulled it from the wall.
What?
I thought, just keep a lid on things till it all blows over.
Business community don't receive this kind of situation very well.
They probably won't receive being eaten very well eith--
What are you doing in here?
You wouldn't understand.
I understand you've got a pretty fucked up idea of animal husbandry.
I'm taking back the farm.
Ah.
Golden boy thinks he can do better, does he?
You wouldn't know where to start.
Jeez, Angus, I couldn't do any worse than you.
No, wait.
It's... one of us.
It's family.
What?
That's how we made the advances-- human DNA.
Mine.
Ours.
You fucker.
Well, it was more of a sperm sample really.
You wanker!
Necessity's the mother of invention.
You've been bitten.
It's nothing.
Just some hippy.
You'll become one of them!
- A hippy?
- No, Angus, one of them.
Only worse.
What are you gonna do, Henry?
Kill me?
- l'm your brother.
- ( banging )
Experience:
They're almost in!
Mrs. Mac:
Upstairs, children!
Well?
The sheep are breaking in. They'll tear you to pieces.
Oh, I don't think so.
Experience:
Henry, hurry!
Goodbye, Angus.
( sheep bleating )
Experience:
Henry!
Come on, now!
( moaning )
( growling )
( growling )
There's another fire escape around the back.
We can take Mrs. Mac's car to town.
Look.
Mrs. Mac:
Now where does he think he's going?
The barn.
His plane.
He can't leave if he's contaminated.
It could affect the whole country.
Mrs. Mac:
You're hurt, dear.
Grant.
We don't know what will happen.
- We've seen what happens!
- Stay calm.
You're a tree.
I'm not a tree!
I'm a fucking sheep.
No, you're a man.
And your father'd be proud of you.
Come on.
You two go.
I'm staying here.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna stop Angus.
If you see me again, you might have to--
No.
I still smell, right?
No, that's just your aura.
How will you get across the lawn?
You don't have a hoof like Angus, they'll tear you to bits.
I'll blend in.
( whispering ) I am a sheep. I am a sheep.
( sheep growls )
( howls )
I am a sheep.
Wait.
You go to town.
Show me how to use this and I'll stay here.
Have you ever fired a gun before, dear?
Well... not as such.
Aim and squeeze, dearie.
That's all there is to it.
Besides... I'll talk you through it.
( gunshot )
( laughing )
You know, this hurts me more than it hurts you.
- ( gunshot ) - ( laughs )
We'll make a farm girl out of you yet.
- ( gunshot ) - ( Mrs. Mac laughing )
( gunshots )
( propeller whirring )
Come on.
Come on, darling.
( groaning )
- ( groaning ) - ( crackling )
( panting )
( chuckles )
( groans )
( Angus groaning )
( Angus growling )
( roars )
Angus?
Stop, Angus!
Look!
We could have run the farm together, if you hadn't ruined everything!
If you hadn't tried to kill me!
Now it has to end.
( screams )
( howling )
( panting )
( roaring )
What?
( dog barking )
Come in.
- Speak up.
- ( growls )
Henry:
Hold him, boy.
Hold him.
Hold him, boy.
Get down.
Get down.
( dog barking )
Hold him.
Hold him, boy.
( yelps )
What?
( growls )
( honking )
( screech )
( grunts )
Tucker.
You're okay.
Oh!
What is that?
Just a little something I picked up in the lab.
Should clear up your worms.
Fix your fly strike too.
Anyway, pull your finger out.
We've got work to do.
- ( whistling ) - ( barking )
Hold 'em, Dice.
Hold 'em.
Good dog.
( barking )
How much of that stuff is there?
Not enough for all of them.
( sheep farting )
Jeez!
Angus, it's over.
No, this is just the beginning.
Come back!
( sheep bleating )
My babies.
Have me again.
( screaming )
( farting )
( groans )
Methane.
Get in behind!
( farts )
( panting )
Last one.
There's a nice bit of wool on that, actually.
- Reckon we should hang onto this one?
- He's a bit toey, but...
Could make good eating.
This is for you.
What do you reckon, boss?
Organic farming?
Nothing but trouble, this modern stuff.
Better just to stick with the way we've always done things, eh?
( whimpering )
( crying )
( sobbing ) I've eaten a rabbit.
Mrs. Mac:
Blanket, dear?
Let's see how we go, eh?
( sobbing )
Snack?
- What are they?
- Mountain oysters.
Well, I do eat a bit of seafood.
No.
Mm, it's good.
Of course it is, dear.
( whispers ) You know you're eating sheep's balls, don't you?
Don't waste it.
( laughing )
Henry:
They'll grow on you.
Mrs. Mac:
What is happening here?
Experience:
No seriously, you could have an organic compost heap.
Or a worm farm.

Okay, settle down.
Got your ears open?
This is the story of a Sad Flute a laughing baby and a weeping sword.
A long, long time ago, in a land far, far away there lived a warrior.
A warrior with empty eyes.
He'd trained his entire life for one purpose to be the greatest swordsman in the history of mankind.
He just achieved his life's ambition, but his heart felt emptier than ever.
These two clans had been warring for 500 years.
And they vowed to keep on warring until one of them didn't have a single man left above Styx.
And so now, here he was, peering down at this very last of his enemy.
When that little warrior princess giggled it did something to him inside.
But this was no time for feeling.
For when he spared that baby's life he put his name at the top of his own clan's death list.
With nothing but the clothes on his back and the baby in his arms he decided to pay a visit to an old warrior friend in a faraway land.
Hey, Johnny I don't like your stinking face.
Easy, Ronald.
The name's Eight-Ball, like in the game.
Good luck for some, bad luck for others.
How can I assist you, my friend from the mystical East?
Haven't been here since Smiley kicked the bucket.
Was a three-day wait just to get your shirts pressed.
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day he sure liked to make a mess in the afterhours, if you know what I mean.
See you in the morning.
You came to me to be strong.
I have made you the strongest.
She will always be the enemy.
Here it is.
Just rub some on your shoulder.
Smiley's Oriental Cure-All.
Works like a charm.
Oh, now, honey, I didn't forget about you.
It's all right there.
It's all right.
Sorry about the tap I gave you.
I thought you knew the sword.
Smiley was always yabbering on about a guy who was gonna roll into town.
But I should've figured.
What do you call her?
I do not know.
She's not yours?
Where's her folks?
Dead.
Best we find you another diaper.
All right.
Smiley, like, your uncle or something?
Friend.
Well, if you were his friend maybe he would like for you to take over his laundry.
Do not know how.
So I'll teach you.
I always done the laundry around here.
That's how I repaid Smiley for teaching me the sword.
Tell you what I'm gonna do, you stay here I'll teach you how to tie a diaper properly.
We'll be partners, 60-40.
You on the 40.
All right now, time to get to work.
You're slower than molasses in January.
You clean that real good, yellow boy.
As clean as Snow White's panties.
If I find the smallest bit of condor crap on my fancy duds well, we gonna have us--
Didn't I tell you I'd rip them off if you didn't watch yourself?
- Let go, you evil little midget.
- Come on...
-...we were just having us some fun.
- Really?
Okay, okay.
Let go.
Get out of here.
How about a home-cooked meal for you and your little'un?
Once that Ferris wheel is finished, it's gonna bring everybody rushing back.
And then we can take the word "travelling" out of "travelling circus."
Hey, Ron.
Welcome to the Eighth Wonder of the World.
Get down here.
Chow bell ringing.
Bravo, bravo.
- Gonna grab some vittles with us?
- No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.
We baked a cake.
Come on, Ron.
What the hell's up with her?
You.
I knew you was trouble the moment you walked into this--
Sounds even better from inside.
You ever seen one of these before?
The sound it's making it's called "opera."
The day my papa found his first chunk of gold, he went out and bought this.
Listen.
Here's my favourite part.
So at the edge of the desert in a busted town full of broken people the warrior began to learn stuff he should've learned a long time ago.
No, no.
Rough.
Like the joy of getting dirty things clean.
Yes.
That's me.
Thank you.
I told you to aim at the line, not at the coin.
All right.
He also learned the joy of losing.
You're gonna need blood and bone of 100 buffaloes as fertiliser.
Smiley always tried to get something to grow.
Never ever lasted too long.
I'm gonna go dig.
Let's see what happens.
He learned you could be happy working with folks.
And finding the simple peace in some private time after a hard day's work.
What's taking you so long?
Come on, Skinny.
You're gonna miss it.
Come on.
And he found that it's nice to have a few friends around when the sun goes down.
But most of all, the warrior learned there's a heck of a lot more pleasure making things grow than there is in cutting them down.
- Let me see that.
- Chuck it here.
You bunch of pups, give me that there goddamned bottle.
- Over here.
I got it.
- Who you think you're playing with?
Over here.
You win.
Show me what you got.
Goddamn, I should've never taught you this game.
You a shark with a poker face.
What happened to her?
Please.
Help me.
- Help me.
- Lynne!
Please.
- Let her go!
- Someone help me.
- Eight-Ball.
-Lynne!
Come here.
Hungry?
No?
Pretty thing.
Damn you!
No!
No!
Lynne!
Lynne!
No!
No--!
Only thing was, when we went to bury her, she was still breathing.
Never known nobody that close to kicking it.
We didn't know what to do with her.
If she was gonna live or die.
So we just put her in bed and waited.
Two days, and she was eating soup.
By the day three she was already sitting up somehow and slinging daggers at the wall.
But God ain't fair and some people just ain't cut out for the knife.
Dang it.
My arm ain't worth a damn.
It is not your arm.
What'd you say?
Are you sure about this?
Because I'm not so good with my eyes open.
Throw.
- I can't do it.
- Do not talk.
Focus.
It is your heart that shakes.
- You dead?
- Not yet.
Sure you're not fountaining blood or anything, are you?
Oh, shit.
I did it.
Thank you, Mr. Sad Flute.
Smiley told me everything.
I just taught you to focus.
Why you do that?
Okay.
I've always been dying to know.
Why you all called the Sad Flutes?
So you got lady Sad Flutes, too?
Sad Flutinas or something?
Yes.
That's nice.
Jumping in the moonlight and kissing as you both fly under the stars to the tunes of the Sad Flutes--
We are called Sad Flutes because when you cut the throat, the last sound is like a sad flute.
Skinny, you sure know how to throw a dead oat into a party room, don't you?
Why'd you become a Sad Flute?
- To be strong. - That it?
My father was working in the field.
I was helping him.
A swordsman came killed my father.
Just to test his sword.
That must've hurt you something bad.
Not hurt...
Hang"! -
Of course you were.
No.
I was angry at my father.
Here.
Take it.
It's a present.
My mama gave it to me.
She said:
"if you hold it over your heart when you're sad it takes away all your sadness."
It works.
Kind of.
Present?
Yeah.
That is your only friend here.
Take good care of it.
Yes, master.
- Tarnations.
- Only to protect, not kill.
What am I gonna kill in this town, armadillo?
Is that what I think it is?
You've sealed it.
So they cannot hear.
Hear what?
The weeping.
Of all the souls I have taken.
Who's listening?
My past.
And if it hears?
No more music.
This is a big country.
Where do we look?
Do not look.
We listen.
He will show.
Think of the sword as part of the body.
Like a finger.
Like a tooth.
I'd rather think of it like metal slicing through a herd of buffalo.
Show me what Smiley taught you.
You do not have the power.
Well, thank you very much.
I did not know that.
But you are fast.
Just have to be faster.
What are you--?
Is this because of yesterday?
I said I was sorry.
Cut it out, Skinny.
I'm serious.
You are slower than molasses in January.
Come on, then.
Cut it out, Skinny.
Stop it, Skinny.
Cut it out.
I'm serious.
Stop.
You bearded nut.
You watch yourself.
Merry Christmas, laundry man.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
We go.
May I have this dance?
Whose birthday?
Well, it's sort of a long story.
Hey, hey, heV-
- Dance with us.
- Hey, you fox.
You gonna take me for a spin or what?
I win.
No.
Until your enemy's heart stops, you have not won.
Is that so?
Did that stop your heart?
That's better.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't get my invitation.
Has anyone seen it'?
No?
Never mind.
We're all here now.
No harm done.
And what did Santa bring you, little boy?
Why, if it ain't a clown.
Looking so sad.
You know, I never found clowns that funny myself.
Don't worry, clown.
I'm a pretty good shot.
Especially when I've been drinking.
H9)'-
Don't go wasting good moonshine.
This shit's smoother than a calf's ass.
But this party's for girls.
Let's all go to the saloon.
What have we here?
Looks like we got ourselves another clown.
Take this clown for a walk.
Ride, ride, ride.
Never quite understood the attraction for the circus.
Till now.
Join the others in Stockton.
I'll catch you up.
Gentlemen, I have a few old memories I'd like to revisit.
Follow me.
Dang it!
He killed my whole family!
Goddamn it, Baptiste, let me go or I swear I'm gonna--
I'm sorry, Lynne.
Lynne, this ain't just for your protection, you know.
It's for the whole goddamn town.
Let me see.
We have a winner.
Gentlemen.
Maria!
He 'vs your marido?
MY apologies.
I am not the kind of man who sleeps with a married woman.
No.
- mommy!
'MOmmy!
No!
But her daughters.
That's a completely different matter.
Clean them up.
You get a bullet in the head for every louse I find.
I once strung a man up by his own hamstrings because he cooked me a steak well-done.
What?
Find that funny?
Or is it because of this?
Thank you, gentlemen.
This girl says she'll serve herself up to you instead of the spics.
Have we met before?
No. We haven't.
This is bound to be a night you will never forget.
You have good teeth.
I like that.
Colonel, as you unwrap me I'm sure you will find there's a whole lot more of me to like.
I have no doubt of that.
And though I may be young I was hoping you could teach me a thing or two.
Life's best lessons tend to hurt.
Sharp pain can bring sharp pleasure.
Tell them to get.
This ain't the theatre.
Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Make yourselves scarce.
Lynne.
She's not here.
Now, I...
I might say some things during...
Feel free to answer if you like.
Nothing is too wrong.
I've been waiting my whole life for a place where it's right to be wrong.
You know I don't think any part of the body is dirty or bad.
Just as long as it's well scrubbed.
Yes.
Assemble.
Now.
Now, where do you plan to begin the inspection?
I like where the skin creases.
Go on.
Between your nice big...
The moment I smelt your neck, it all came flooding back.
No girl could ever smell as sweet.
You changed it all.
My world.
My face.
You changed my life, little girl.
And now I'm going to change yours.
That certainly is a beautiful scar I gave you.
A hard-on for a scar now, that is wrong.
I forgot nothing tonight is wrong.
Wrists.
Tell the cook to fry up some potatoes.
And while we're waiting I thought I should give you what I was so generously offering 10 years ago.
Enjoy the show.
No. He's mine.
Lynne.
Are you all right?
Cover me.
Hold on.
Lynne.
Did she kill him?
Pull it off.
- She got the wrong guy.
- That ain't him.
Oh, God, help us.
Merry Christmas!
Sweet mother of God, it's a goddamn butcher shop in here.
- What's going on?
- Let's go look at this.
I must go, or you will all be in danger.
We're in danger already.
- Colonel's on the loose.
- That's right.
Lynne smoked the wrong guy.
Now the Colonel's coming back and he's bringing the whole family.
We need the guy who did that butcher job in the saloon.
I say we all just pack up and leave.
Right.
If you stay and fight, you'll die like rats.
Well, we'll die like rats with rifles.
What rifles?
You got a chink with a sword and a bunch of juggling idiots.
How dare you?
That ain't all we got.
H9)'-
Beth will understand.
Follow me.
I ruined everything didn't I?
You did what you had to do.
You could have just grabbed April and hit the trail but you didn't.
Knowing saving me would ruin every new thing you found here.
This new world without you not so new.
Hey, let's say somehow they all come and go and we're still breathing.
You're still gonna leave, right?
That is the plan.
Maybe I could go with you?
Just think about it, all right?
Hey.
That's my primo cactus juice.
I knew what you was from the get go.
Don't need to look at the size of a man I can smell the blood.
It was on you too.
Yeah.
Good.
Now, get my jacket clean if you can.
If I'm gonna die, I wanna look good doing it.
Why die?
We only got 100 sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.
That ain't much more than to sting them with.
You also have that.
Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.
You do good shooting.
For a drunken man.
Why you stop shooting?
Well, I just went around robbing banks, hitting trains till I ran into the only force that can truly bring down any outlaw.
Sheriff?
Woman.
When I was with her, I didn't wanna run.
What happened then?
There was a couple of rangers who hadn't forgot about me.
They ambushed me.
Bullets flying everywhere.
One of them found Beth.
Last thing she ever said to me was, "Don't never pick up no gun again."
So far...
Well, at least till today I done what she asked.
But for fellas like me and you we are what we are.
Because we're sand they're flowers.
These are yours.
These are to kill.
Come.
Closer.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Remember these places.
Fastest way to kill your enemy.
I will remember.
Company charge!
What was that?
H9)'-
What the hell--?
Come on!
Take cover!
Get up there.
- Everybody, up there.
- Over there, come on.
Come on, men.
Get them, down there.
Get down.
Shoot them!
- Come on!
- Move over!
Yeah!
Let's go.
Come on down.
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
Shoot them!
Oh, shit.
- Dynamite!
- Run for your lives!
Take cover!
Let's move it!
Shit.
We did it.
- Oh, no.
- They hit Jacques.
Come on.
Back to town.
- Get back. - Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's close this damn circus down!
Burn it!
- Move it out.
- Let's go!
Come on!
Kill.
Run.
Hey, come on.
Into the hotel.
Keep low.
Get them!
Here, take her.
Skinny!
I couldn't protect April.
Guard the hallway!
And don't let a damn soul into this room!
What the--?
One more step and she's soup.
I said stop!
That sure is a pretty scar I gave you.
I'll see you in hell, little girl.
Wear something nasty.
Is this the new life you have found?
Funny, look much like the old one.
Do you think you will tell her that you killed her mother her father and her entire clan?
She is the enemy.
She will always be the enemy.
You came to me to be strong.
I have made you the strongest.
Kill her now.
You do not belong here.
I do.
I did.
You have the perfect body for an assassin.
The heart of a priest.
Your heart will become your biggest enemy.
You must kill your biggest enemy.
We are assassins.
All that we love we will destroy.
You are assassin.
All that you love you will destroy.
Did we win?
We survived.
Some of us.
I'm not going with you...
"-3711 I?
I guess that's the end of them.
No it is just the beginning.
What about the baby, she gonna be safe?
They are listening for this to cry.
Not her.
That's right, sand man keep walking.
The warrior walked away.
And legend has it, he never stopped walking.
Always making sure to keep as much distance as possible between himself and the little gal he loved.
How much?
Free.

You ordered the fuel filter for that Dodge?
(SIGHS)
Yeah.
RAY:
Well, it's the wrong damn one.
And now they're pitching a bitch over there.
I ordered what you told me to.
I don't order the wrong parts, son.
And if Western Auto don't trade that filter out, it's coming out of your damn check.
(SIGHS)

That numb nuts I got working for me, he screwed everything up.

Brand new?
No, ain't got but about 2,000 miles on it.
But we need to get her greased up for a trip up north.
Well, we can do her.
We just can't do her till next week.
We got four cars ahead of you, and I'm closed tomorrow.
Well, well, that's...
That's just bad luck on both our parts.
Ain't it?
Say, chief, you don't know where I might could hire me a driver for a week or two, do you?
RAY:
No. No.
Might do it myself just to drive this girl, but I gotta keep my hand on the plow here.
Pay's good.
(STAN CHUCKLING) No,no,no.
Don't you tempt me.
Sir.
That driving job, how much does it pay?
Well, I see you can grease them.
How do I know you can drive them?
I can drive them.
$10 a day plus meals and room.
When does it start?
Looks like you already got a job, son.
When does it start?
Can you handle a car in the snow?
Hell, I bet you ain't even never seen snow.
All right, look, be at this address Monday at 8:00.

STAN:
Boss, we're using the name Wells on this trip.
This is Mr. Wells.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Okay, then.
Need to make it to Knoxville tonight, about seven, eight hours.
Might be some bad weather coming in.
Now, your passenger is not to have any whiskey, do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Now, he's gonna ask.
But if he shows up drunk or too hungover to work, you don't get paid.
Are we understood?
Yes, sir.
Have a nice trip.
Don't he have any luggage?
Everything's in the trunk.

It's all right, Mary.
Come on back.
I swear.
Son, you look like hell.
Why don't we put you back in the hospital again?
Oh!
I gotta go to work.

You don't look fine.
Where's your wife?
Which one?

Wanna make things right.
That won't be easy.
(SIGHS)
I wanna take care of the...
You know, the birth and all that.
Will you be the one to do it?
Most likely.
Well, this should cover it.
If you need anything else, you just ask me.
You know I'm good for it.
You shouldn't be going anywhere, son.
One of these days, you're gonna have to learn spina bifida's not like the common cold.

He shouldn't have done that.
I want you to pass his ass right now.
Mr. Wells, you're not gonna shoot...
Hey, just do as I say!
Please, Mr. Wells, we can't...
Do not call me by my name.
Are we clear on that?
Now, I want you to get my Eldorado Cadillac around this dirt dog or I'm gonna blow them big ass ears of yours right off your head!

I was trying to stay ahead of the storm.
Yeah.
They're calling for sleet all the way to Carolina.
(COUGHING)
How far is it to Bristol?
Oh, about five hours, I guess.
I don't know with this weather, though.
I think this is a big one coming in.
Well, your oil was fine, but she was thirsty.
That's $8 even.
I'll be right back with your change.
Hey, you got a snack machine or anything in there?
No, it's busted.
Got some leftover Christmas candy though.
You can have all that you want.
I don't eat that crap.
Is there any place I can get some supper around here?
There's a diner about 10 miles up the road.
Any damn good?
No, but it's all there is.

Well, let's go, boy.
I'm about to starve to death.

OI' Snake Belly told you
I wasn't supposed to drink any whiskey now, didn't he?
He said I don't get paid if you show up drunk.
Boy, who do you think is paying you?
Fire that weasel-eyed thief anyway.
Yes, operator, I'm still here.
OPERATOR:
The call has been refused.
What do you mean, refused?
The party will not accept the charges.
He does not know a Mr. Combs.
Oh.
Can you try again with the name Mr. Wells?
That's my employer.
That's who I'm calling for.

Where are you, boy?
And where'd you come up with a doofus name like Silas Combs?
Is this Mr. O'Keefe?
Who is this?
This is Silas Combs.
My instructions were to call you.
Where's Stan?
I don't think I know Stan.
He's a tall guy.
Mr. Wells calls him Snake Belly.
Oh, yes.
That's who gave me the job.
Why aren't you calling him?
Well, this is the number he gave me.
I thought you were Mr. Wells' business manager.
No, I'm not his business manager.
Where are you?
Chattanooga.
Chattanooga?
Is that all?
Yeah, we got a late start.
And then the weather turned bad on us.
Is he drinking?
No. No, sir.
Yeah, right.
You may have noticed Mr. Wells will take a drink of whiskey.
Yes, sir, I have noticed that.
Look, it is very important that you get him to Charleston tomorrow and that you get him there sober.
Are you listening to me?
Now, there are a lot of people, mainly him, who are counting on you.
This is your one and only job.
I'll do my best, sir.
All right.
Call me in the morning.
I wanna know when you leave.
Okay-
(SIGHS)
I'm expecting somebody.
A doctor.
Need me a shot of B12.
Work like a charm.
What're you drinking, Sorbonne?
Nothing, thanks.
I asked you what you were drinking.
Beer, I guess.
WOMAN 1:
Is that that country singer?
WOMAN 2:
Yeah, I think it is.
I do love a road trip.
Hey, how old are you?
Nineteen.
Oh.
Good.
I'd hate to think I was contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
Thank you.
Hey, chief.
Can you get those two pretty girls over there a round of drinks on us, please?
So you like beer, boy?
I can take it or leave it.
Not me, Sorbonne.
Not me.
Is that your doctor?
Yeah.
Guess I better go get that shot of B12.

Mr. O'Keefe, this is Silas Combs.
O'KEEFE:
Tell me you're on the road and not still at the hotel.
He won't wake up.
He just keeps rolling back to sleep.
Oh, hell.
Did he get drunk last night?
Yes, he did.
The doctor came about 11:30.
What doctor?
Why, I guess they're friends.
He gave him a vitamin shot or something.
(SIGHS) Son, you gotta get moving.
What do I do?
He looks real bad.
You want me to call that doctor back?
No. Can you dress him?
Okay-
Now, listen to me.
Everything, and I mean everything, is riding on you getting there tonight.
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Here we go again.
(SIGHS)
I'm getting too old for this.
MAN: (SINGING) When leaves begin to die
That means
He's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome

A falling star Lights up a purple Sky And as I wonder
Where you are
I'm so lonesome
I could cry

Turn the radio on.

Never much cared for it.
What the hell time is it, anyway?
About 11130.
What we got, like 300 more miles to go?
More like 400.
Well, you gonna have to do better than that, boy.
I gotta be there in seven hours.
The roads are real bad, sir.
I'm going over the speed limit as it is.
I can't go any faster.
Boy, this Eldorado is the best damn car that ever rolled out of Detroit.
There ain't no road she don't eat for lunch.
Well, I can make it up when we get on the highway.
Punch it, boy.
(I'M WINGING MY WAY BACK HOME CONTINUES PLAYING)
How the hell did I get in this car?
I put you here.
Did I dress myself?
No, sir, I did it for you.
You didn't go poking around in my suitcase now, did you?
I put your gun in there after I unloaded it.
You do anything else?
No, sir.
You sure about that?
Yes, sir, I'm very sure.
'Cause I know exactly how much traveling money I brought with me, boy.
I didn't see no money 'cause I wasn't looking for no money, sir.
I changed you into a fresh shirt and left you in your pants and your drawers from last night, it's all the same to you, sir.
You can stop calling me "sir."
I'll stop calling you "sir" when you stop calling me "boy."
Well, now, that's fair.
I call you Sorbonne.
I like that.
How old do you think I am, Sorbonne?
I ain't much at guessing games.
Go on, guess.
I don't know.
Twenty-nine.
Oh, that surprise you?
Yes, sir, it does.
It's all that clean living I done.
It ain't natural.
(SIGHS)
My God, what a headache.
CHORUS ON RADIO: (SINGING) Because the king of beers is leading all the rest
When you say Budweiser, you've said it all
(SIGHS)
Is this your business, son?
Driving people around the country?
No, sir.
This is the first time.
Fact, this is the first time I've been out of Alabama.
What is your business then?
I work at the garage.
Ray's?
Yes, sir.
You like it?
Not really.
No, Ray screams a whole lot.
Thinks I'm worthless.
Well, there's no surprise there.
Ray's an asshole.
What would you rather be doing?
I don't know.
You don't think about what you'd rather be doing?
Why not?
Well, I ain't gonna get to, anyway.
I don't see the point.
(EXHALES)
Boy, you're gonna have to pull over.
I gotta take a leak.
Do you mind if I ask what business you're in?
Yes, I damn hell do mind.
What the hell business you think I'm in?
I reckon you're in the music business.
You really don't know who I am, son?
Sir?
Wells isn't my real name.
It's just a traveling name.
Why don't you like music?
Everybody likes music.
I just don't.
There's no reason.
You don't ever listen to the radio?
I don't got a radio.
You want one?
I guess.
No radio, huh?
Nope.
How about a girl?
You got yourself a girl, Sorbonne?
No, sir.
You think there might be a connection there?
Sir?
I asked you not to call me "sir" anymore.
You do like girls, right?
Yes, sir.
I mean, yeah.
Hugging and kissing, that sort of thing, that appeal to you?
Yeah.
I'm gonna tell you a little secret.
They love to dance.
Oh, they love it when you make them swing a little bit.
Make them cry a little bit.
You don't think I'm riding in the back of that Cadillac there on account of my good looks now, do you?
What is your real name, then?
It's Luke.
Just Luke, 0l' buddy.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Oh, hell.
Well, you gonna have to make a move.
I can't.
I can't pass this many cars.
(CAR HORNS HONKING)
What the hell is an old truck like that doing out here in the first place?
You got to do it, Sorbonne.
Mr. Wells, I can't pass this many people.
We can take them on the right.
Mr. Wells...
Just do it!
He's exiting up here.
I can see the turnoff.
Sorbonne, I got some news for you.
You're gonna stay on your side of town unless you learn how to start making decisions.
Or let me put it in another way.
If I'm not in Charleston, West Virginia by 7:00, not only are you not getting paid, boy, your ass is walkin' back to Alabama.
Oh, man.
(CAR HORN HONKING)
Oh, my God!
HANK: (LAUGHING) Sorbonne!
Oh, my God!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Get your ass turned around, get over to the side of the road.
Right now.
Sir, are you all right?
I been better, son.
I been better.
Let me see your license.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
No, sir, I have not.
You just keep moving.
Just move it.
Where you boys headed?
Charleston, West Virginia.
Would you care to tell me what the hell that was all about back there?
We're in a real hurry, sir.
He's gotta be there by tonight.
I'm awfully sorry for driving the way I was.
Officer, I'll be more than happy to pay the fine.
Hell, I'll even pay double the good state of Tennessee.
They been awful kind to me.
Put your wallet back in your pocket, sir.
Now, I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna drive straight 4 and 3/10 miles to the town of Loudon.
You're gonna turn right on Maple Street.
There's the courthouse.
You can tell your story to the justice of the peace.
Well, we sure will.
And I thank you, Officer.
I hope you have a nice day.
I'll be right behind you.
Well, that went pretty well.
(BELL TOLLING)
What in the world's in Charleston?
Mr. Wells is in the music business, and he's expected there tonight, Your Honor.
Is he a performer?
Well, he has a guitar.
I reckon he is.
You don't know?
I just started yesterday.
I don't really work for him, though.
I work for Ray's Tire and Auto.
But I only took the job 'cause a man needed a driver.
Then he quit, so I had to...
Son, have a seat.
This is gonna take longer than I thought.
Yes, sir.
Where's the passenger?
He was settling up with the driver whose car got bent, and now he's vomiting in the men's room.
Did you question him?
Not yet.
Trooper Hamilton here detected the strong odor of alcohol in your vehicle.
Is the passenger the only person been drinking?
Yes, sir.
Well, that helps you a little, son, but you're still in trouble.
What in the hell were you thinking?
I can't say no to him.
You know, he's got a real temper.
He made you?
Yes, sir.
How'd he do that?
Did he have a gun?
Did he threaten you?
He said I'd have to walk home if I didn't.
But you were in control of the vehicle.
And your license says you're a legal adult.
Now that makes you the responsible party.
You should've said no, son.
That would have been a whole lot better decision.
Am I going to jail?
I apologize for the delay, Your Honor.
Are you all right?
Touch of the flu.
Well, we're almost done here.
So you're pleading guilty to the trooper's charge?
$100 or 10 days in jail.
What about the car?
Are you the owner?
Yes, I am.
Show me the proof, and I reckon you're free to go.
Mr. Wells, sir, I ain't got any money.
I was just doing like you asked.
(LAUGHING)
Just pay the damn fine, Sorbonne.
You gotta get me to Charleston.
He's just doing his job, like you boys.
It's my fault.
Well, how 'bout you boys slowin' down and enjoying' the ride?
Lot of drunks out there on New Year's.
We'll do that.
You all have a happy New Year now, all right?
HAMILTON:
You all take it easy next time.
(GASPING)
Had you goin' for a minute back there, didn't I?
You don't look so good.
I just need to take a nap, is all.
We better get goin'.
We got some time to make up.
Yes, sir.
Turn on the radio.
(SOFT COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)
Bristol.
Virginia on one side of the street, Tennessee on the other.
This here's the cradle, Sorbonne.
Sir?
Country music.
Jimmie Rodgers and the Carters, they brought it down from the mountains, turned it into pure gold.
Is it really 1:00?
Yes, sir.
I mean, yeah.
We ain't gonna make it, are we?
Maybe 10:00 or 11:00 if the road stays clear, but it's clouding up again.
It might snow.
Damn.
A lot of people counting on 0l' Luke, boy. A lot of people.
Take the next left up here.
WOMAN ON PA:
Flight 892 is now boarding.
AH passengers please proceed to the gate.
Flight 892 is now boarding.
All passengers please proceed to the gate.
(SIGHS)
No more flights to Charleston till tomorrow.
Closest I can get is Wheeling, and that flight doesn't leave till 8:00.
Let's find us a charter.
Yes, sir.
Just give us five minutes, we'll get her all fueled up and ready to go.
Sorry about the rush.
Hell of a way to spend your New Year's.
Well, you're paying for the privilege, hoss.
(COUGHS)
(THUNDER CRACKING)
(LAUGHING)
You ain't never been on a plane before, have you, Sorbonne?
Well, it beats grease-monkeying for that asshole Ray, though, don't it?
Where are we?
Right on top of Charleston.
It's all socked in with snow and fog.
Can't land anywhere for 100 miles.
Okay, so?
Sorry, hoss.
We're gonna have to turn around and head back or we're not gonna have enough fuel to get back to Bristol.
Just get me into Bristol.
Roger.
Well, it was fun while it lasted, Sorbonne.
PREACHER ON RADIO:
Now there's only one way you're gonna find peace.
There's only one way you're gonna find happiness.
There's only one way you're gonna find joy.
Now, let me tell you...
Here comes the hook.
He's gonna ask for money right now.
Now, I ain't much asking for help.
But the good Lord gave me the word, and I can't do his work all by myself.
And that's where you come in.
Now, you may be asking, "Preacher,
Turn that polecat off.
"How much does God want me to give?"
Well, how much you think...
He said the world was gonna end in '49, too.
Said it in Tuscaloosa right after 'Bama lost to Tennessee.
Folks there thought it already had.
(THE LAST RIDE PLAYING ON RADIO)
Can you turn that heat up any more?
Yes, sir.
Sorbonne.
Sir?
If you call me sir one more time, I'm gonna go get my pistol.
(MOANS)
You all right?
I just need to eat something.
We gonna have to make us a phone call.
Will you do it for me, Sorbonne?
Yeah.
I will.
"Signs following."
How's that?
Well, that church back there, the message board said "Signs following." What does that mean?
Oh. it means they dance and shake with the Holy Spirit.
Oh.
And they handle rattlesnakes, too.
It's a hell of a show.
(FIDDLE PLAYING)
(MEN WHOOPING)
(BAND PLAYING FOLK MUSIC)
Smell meat.
Sure hope it ain't squirrel.
Might be possum.
MAN: (SINGING) Well, I wish I was in London or some seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat and I'd sail the ocean 'round
While sailing 'round the ocean while sailing 'round the sea
I'd think of handsome Molly wherever she may be
(DOORBELL TINKLES)
Help ya?
How 'bout some grub for the weary travelers?
Got some soup going.
How's that suit you?
That suits us just fine.
How y'all doin' today?
What do you call these parts 'round here?
Muhlenberg County.
It's God's country, ain't it?
Y'all mind if I warm my hide by that stove there?
Come on in.
(COUGHS)
Here you go.
Thank you.
(MAN STRUMMING GUITAR)
You play that thing pretty good now, don't you?
I find my way around it.
Well, let's hear it, if you don't mind.
I don't mind.
You want a blast?
Help take that chill away.
(LAUGHS)
Why hell, I was wonderin' when you was gonna ask me.
Colder than a polar bear's tit out there and you damn Virginians make a Alabama boy beg for some sunshine.
(LAUGHING)
(BAND PLAYING FOLK MUSIC)
You like hillbilly music?
Yeah, I like hillbilly music.
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.
Where are you, son?
Virginia, about an hour north of Bristol.
We ran into a little trouble outside of Knoxville.
What kind of trouble, Silas?
Police trouble.
We ain't gonna make it to Charleston by 7:00.
Yeah, I kind of put that together, son.
Thank you very much.
I'm really looking forward to this next call I'm gonna have to make.
Damn it, boy!
I thought we'd left all this stuff behind.
Four thousand people waiting to see him on New Year's Eve.
I think you got a bigger problem than that, sir.
What do you mean?
I mean, he's powerful sick.
Oh, hell, he's just hungover.
No, sir, I know hungover.
I've seen that my whole life.
This is much worse.
I think he better go to a hospital or come home.
It's that bad?
Yes, sir, it is.
This business is killing him.
And quitting' it would kill him quicker.
What do you want me to do?
Well, there's no point in going to Charleston.
They'd probably just lynch you two anyway.
(SIGHS) Tell you what.
Get him to Ohio for the matinee tomorrow, and I'll meet you there.
Yes, sir.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
Thanks.
(WHOOPING)
He had a wife and six kids, and he ain't never comin' out of that hole.
Not even 30-years-old.
That's a damn shame.
STORE KEEPER:
That ain't the worst part.
What do you reckon the company give his family?
$100.
A man's life's only worth $100.
(SINGING) Trouble, leave me alone
Trouble, leave me alone
You were in that bar in Arkansas
Every bottle in East Tennessee
You left a trace in the lines of my face in the gutters of Bourbon Street
Trouble, leave me alone
Why must you torture me?
I wish you'd find another home
I wish you'd just let me be
Trouble, leave me alone
Oh!
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
I need something, Sorbonne.
It's bad.
Okay.
Let me get you to a doctor.
No.
There's a town just up ahead.
I just need me some Pepto-Bismol, is all.
(RETCHES)
Here you go.
(COUGHING)
I gotta get you to a hospital.
What's the damn point?
SILAS:
Mr. Wells...
It's Luke.
My name's Luke.
(STATIC ON RADIO)
Nothin'.
How far is it to Canton, Ohio?
About 300 miles.
(SIGHS)
You know, there was a time when I didn't dream about nothin' but this.
So be careful what you wish for, Sorbonne.
It might just fall on you.
What do you dream about?
Nothin', sir.
Do me a favor.
Stop being respectful and kissin' my ass.
Don't treat me like a boss man and don't keep quiet just 'cause I'm the man in the backseat.
And make me feel like there's somebody real up there and not just the back of some hired man's head.
Can I ask you a question first?
You were gonna leave me back there in Tennessee, weren't you?
Well, 0l' Luke has a history in this part of the world.
Figured I might have to get while the gettin' was good and find somebody else to bail your ass out.
What are you writin'?
Oh.
None of your damn business, that's what.
We was talkin' about you.
You go to high school?
I quit in the 10th grade.
How come?
Just didn't take.
Didn't take.
So you fix cars.
Yeah.
But you ain't any damn good at it.
Well, I just don't care for it, is all.
But what do you care for? Not music.
We know that.
Not really.
Sports?
Baseball, football?
Cock fighting?
How 'bout girls?
We already talked about women, right?
Yeah, we did.
You ever have one?
No.
You're probably better off for it.
All they do is tear your heart out and then leave you standing there like a damn fool.
What's your daddy do?
Time.
Oh.
That's why that old boy back there scared the shit out of you.
You scared of that, ain't you?
Followin' in Daddy's footsteps.
How 'bout your mama, then?
What's she do?
I don't wanna talk about this.
My mama ran a whorehouse.
Beat that.
Don't wanna talk about my family, Mr. Wells.
Luke.
Whatever your name is.
(LAUGHING)
My daddy took me down to Gulf Shores when I was a boy.
Told me about footprints in the sands of time.
I didn't understand it then.
I think I might now.
It don't matter, Sorbonne.
Not a damn bit of it matters for nothin'.
WOMAN: (SINGING) There's gotta be some freedom from these worries on my mind
(COUGHING) There's gotta be some rest for me somewhere down the line Gonna end this lonesome journey
I started long ago
Find a place to stop on...
Your friend don't look too good.
Yeah, I know.
What do you call these parts?
Freedom County, near Mount Hope.
Your differential's leaking.
It's probably just a seal.
Caddies do that.
This is brand new, though.
How far are you goin'?
Ohio.
Hmm.
Just a gasket.
Nothing critical, but you're gonna wanna get it looked at when you get there.
You the mechanic?
It's my station.
Everything here.
And it's just you?
Just me.
Well, it was my daddy's.
Died last year of the black lung.
So, New Year's Eve.
Yup.
You from around here?
Born and raised.
We're from Alabama.
Saw that.
You know, he's in the music business.
(COUGHING)
I'm not, though.
$6.
A 50?
Got anything smaller than this?
Sorry.
You sure that's all you got?
I only have three 5's and a stack of 1's.
Do you want me to buy something else?
Don't really matter.
We'll be closed tomorrow anyway.
Are you celebrating tonight?
Nothin' to celebrate.
Not this year.
How about it just being over, then?
I might drink to that.
Stop talking.
You made me lose count.
Sorry about that.
Damn.
What is it?
I only got $42.
We're even?
Deal.
My name's Silas.
Wanda.
It's very nice to meet you, Silas.
Happy New Year.
Dirty Johns.
Honky-tonk up the 56 outside of Mount Hope.
About all there is between here and Ohio.
Well, I'd like to have that drink with you, Wanda.
You and your friend from the music business?
Thanks, but I gotta do the books.
(SIGHS)
You know, I ain't never asked a girl out before.
I reckon I was about scared half to death what you just said.
But now that you did, I don't know what I was so scared of.
It's New Year's Eve.
Why don't you let 0l' Luke buy you a drink somewhere?
No,Luke.
Tonight, I'm buying.
Oh, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
(CHINO PLAYING)
MAN: (SINGING) I'm going from Reno down to Chino with a beautiful Latino that I stole from Kino Gino when he lost his poker face
How he'll get up to Fargo I'll sure be damned if I know
Evening, boys.
Fellas.
SINGER:
Oh, let's go!
My woman left me back in Tahoe for a man they call Diablo
I'd like to say I miss her so but it's a sin to lie
'Cause that darling little Sheila's
You look like you never been honky-tonking before.
Well, I haven't.
Well, it's tricky.
But I'll talk you through it.
(MALE SINGER VOCALIZING)
When we got to San Diego said her llamo was Consuelo
She no speak Americana and I don't hablo Mexican
Well, it's a good thing that she was pretty 'cause when we pulled into that city
I found out she was all woman
And boy, she knew I was all man
(VOCALIZING)
Happy New Year, Sorbonne.
Happy New Year.
SINGER:
Let's take it home.
You ever played in a place like this?
About 1,000, I reckon.
Gonna get your guitar?
(CHUCKLES)
No, I think I better save that for tomorrow.
Mr. O'Keefe will meet us there.
How'd he take it when you told him
I wasn't gonna make Charleston?
He wasn't too happy.
No. I guess he wouldn't be.
He had to cash in a few favors to get me a book there.
(MUSIC STOPS)
(ALL APPLAUDING)
This may come as a surprise to you, Sorbonne, but I have a reputation of being a bit of a problem child.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I ain't never had a friend, Sorbonne.
Even
I don't know the first thing about loyalty 'cause I ain't never seen it.
I'm sorry about Tennessee.
I was thinking about what you said earlier.
Maybe driving's a good business to be in.
Well, you passed your audition.
You made it two days with me, and you're still here.
That's better than anybody, so far.
(BAN D PLAYING ILENE)
I saw you talkin' to that little thing at the filling' station.
I asked her out.
You did what?
She said no.
Well, that don't mean nothin'.
That's part of a woman's schooling', you know?
They always say no on the first go-round.
She didn't mean it.
I think she meant it.
Mmm-mmm.
No, I saw her watching' you, and now I know why.
This is a threshold moment for you, Sorbonne.
I want you to take my Cadillac, and go back to that filling' station and get you a date for New Year's.
Mr. Wells, look at me.
All the money I got is yours in an envelope.
She can smell what side of town I come from.
And besides, she said no.
She has to do her books.
On New Year's Eve?
All right.
You go and get that woman.
And you get to keep this on top of everything else.
Now, if you don't get her, you don't get paid for nothin'.
That's not the deal we made.
You just ask Mr. O'Keefe what a son of a bitch I can be, in case you suddenly have cause to doubt.
I can't leave you here alone.
I'll be all right.
OI' Luke, he can fend for himself pretty good.
Thought you said all they did was tear our hearts out?
Well, hell, you gotta die of somethin'.
I'll be back.

We're just passin' through.
From here, there.
From everywhere.
We are drivin' through on our way up from Alabama to Charleston.
Oh, I love Alabama.
It's so pretty.
I love that state.
It's a great state.
WOMAN:
Sorry.
Don't mind him.
He's just my ex-husband.
I hope I'm not causing any trouble.
No.
He's just more of a nuisance than anything.
Is that right?
(PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(GRUNTING)
Stop it!
Stop!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?
He's sick.
If he's so sick, then why is he dancing with my wife?
Ex-wife, Leroy!
(PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Asshole!
You wanna go again?
You done or you want some more?
DIRTY JOHN:
That's enough of that crap.
It's almost New Year's.
Now, get in here and enjoy yourselves.
Hey, you okay?
Get me to the car.
Okay.
Is he okay?
He'll be fine.
What happened?
What in the hell do you think happened?
He sucker punched me.
Well, let's just get out of here.
I'll find you a hotel.
Not so fast, Sorbonne.
I'll be fine.
I'll just be a second.
The hell, you say.
I stopped off at the river, Tonto.
Filled my canteen.
If you're back in less than an hour, you're fired.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Is he okay?
He's about the same.
I changed my mind.
Well, I'm glad.

Hillbilly champagne.
Cheers, then.

What, drink moonshine?
You know what I mean.
I just...
I didn't wanna, you know... (TENNESSEE WALTZ PLAYING) Hey, do you like this music?
Yeah, it's all right, I guess.
Would you dance with me?
Even if I ain't much good?
How do you know you're not?
I ain't never done it before.
Just go like you did in that fight out there, but slower and a lot less hitting'.
Okay-
(SINGING)
I introduced him to my loved one
And while they were dancin' my friend stole my sweetheart from me

Oh, I know just how much

I really appreciate this.
It's the least I could do after the free floor show you boys give us last night.
I sure do apologize for that.
(ANGEL BAND PLAYING)
I saw him play in Shreveport once.
You know, a man came after him on the stage for the same damn thing.
I guess trouble just seems to find that 0l' boy.
But like I need to tell you.
Yeah.
It's on me.
Thank you.
And this too.
Now, you tell him that my stage is his any damn time he wants it.
I'll do that.

I got at least 100.
Over at the bank, we give 'em out free.
Compliments First National.
You want a calendar?
No, this'll do me just fine.
MAN:
I'll help you.
That's okay.
I've taken enough of your time.
Hell, I don't mind.
Earl's about to speak, and he's about as exciting as watching' paint dry.
I just come for the singing'.
This 0l' boy looks like he's in a little trouble there.
He just had a rough night.
You know, New Year's and all.
If you say so.
All right, that should be enough.
Thank you.
That's yours.
Be careful out there.
We sure will.
Thanks again.
God bless you.
Both of you.

Hey,Luke, time to wake up.
I gotta find us a place to eat.
You ever been here before?
Come on, Luke, time to wake up.
Mr. O'Keefe's waitin' for us in Canton, and he's madder than hell at the both of us already.
(TIRES SCREECHING) (HORNS BLARING)
SILAS Luke!
Luke.
Hey, Mr. Wells.
Thank you.
Thanks for your help.
Looks like it was a heart attack.
He had two broke ribs.
Appreciate it.
You give your statement?
Yes, sir.
Well, I guess it was a heart attack.
But he had two broken ribs.
What you know about that, son?
Got into a fight last night over this woman.
I never should've let him go in there, you know?
I knew he was feeling bad.
I let him have moonshine, and whiskey and beer.
And I left him alone for a while.
I'm really sorry, Mr. O'Keefe.
I'm so sorry.
You know, I traveled with him for six years, worked with him for 10.
This was not the first time.
I can promise you that.
Now, he did this himself, okay?
He didn't need a bit of help from you or anybody else.
What happens now?
(SIGHS) Well, we'll take him back to Alabama, I guess.
Need a driver?
We'll handle it.
But you might wanna steer clear of that vulture fight that's about to break out.
I wish I could.
We owe you some money.
No, sir, I won't take it.
I didn't do the job you hired me to do.
You gave him what he wanted.
He was the only one that wanted to do this trip.
Besides, he said in his note to give you some money to buy a radio, whatever the hell that means.
(SIREN WAILING)
I got a lot to do before the family gets here.
Should I wait for the police?
I'll handle it.
Could I get somebody to give me a ride to a bus station, then?
Well, you ought to be able to get yourself there.
What you do from there is your business.
Now, I'm not a lawyer, and I don't know that he was ever of sound mind,
but that's definitely his signature.
Which means that you are the new owner of this automobile.
I reckon something must've gone right out there.
I can't.
Why not?
It was his to give.
And there's plenty of it for the rest of them to fight over.
Trust me.
Should I go back there?
Well, you can go wherever you wanna go.
But I'd do it pretty quick, if I was you.
You done good, Mr. Combs.
You done good.
Thank you.

Harry Truman was our president
A coke and burger cost you 30 cents
I was still in love with Mavis Brown
On the night Hank Williams came to town
"I Love Lucy" debuted on TV
That was one big event we didn't see
'Cause no one stayed at home for miles around it was the night Hank Williams came to town
Momma ironed my shirt and Daddy let me take the truck
I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night Hank Williams came to town
A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper, "Hey, that's him"
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
(CROWD CHEERING) it was the night Hank Williams came to town
On and on, he sang into the night
"Jambalaya," "Cheatin' Heart" "I Saw the Light"
And how'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown on the night Hank Williams came to town?

JIMMY:
The guy I just saved is a cop.
That's not the usual way I do things, but sometimes you gotta abandon your principles and do what's right.
Here's the story.
This is the way it went down.
(CAT YOWLING)
- Shit!
- You okay?
You made me spill my fucking coffee!
Agh.
Now it's gonna look like I pissed in my pants.
God damn it.
The way you whipped around that cat, you don't even like cats.
I got no problem with cats.
I don't like dander.
So you almost roll your car trying not to hit one out of 600 million cats in the world?
It's bad luck killing a cat.
Pretty good reflexes for an old guy.
I got your old guy.
You ready?
Louis is ready.
Let's go to work.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Oh, my God.
Who do I have to fuck to get you two assbags to...
Sir, if we could just come in for a minute.
I don't give a shit about your badge, man.
You got a fucking warrant?
'Cause I'm paying a grand a night for this suite, and I'm about to get laid.
So if you ain't room service and you ain't got a warrant, then you can go fuck yourselves.
Keep your fucking pants on!
Well, what the fuck is this?
I'm gonna have your job, tough guy.
I still don't see any paper, which means you got no legal authority to be here.
You must not like your job much, huh, shithead?
Right now, I'm loving it.
Ah!
(GRUNTS)
JIMMY:
Don't forget to get his watch and wallet.
Right.

Needs to look like a break-in.
I didn't see a thing!
I don't even know the guy!

And?
And I handled it.
Wanna say goodbye?
Fucker!
- What's bothering you?
- Nothing.
Come on, something's got your panties in a knot.
Why else are we gonna go meet Ronnie Earl in public?
Yeah, I don't trust that redneck prick, that's why.
Job's done.
Went fine, no problem.
Why don't you do me a favour?
When we get our dough, why don't you go away a while?
Take a vacation, maybe go up river, see your mother.
You wanna clue me in?
I didn't shoot that hooker.
LOLA:
No!
Jesus.
She saw you?
- Yeah, but she ain't gonna say nothing.
- How do you know?
'Cause she's more afraid of us than the cops, that's why.

Hey, y'all, what do you need?
Miller Lite, and a whisky for my friend.
You got a preference?

Some kind of whisky nobody's ever heard of.
Why don't you bring your own bottle?
Give him the best bourbon you got, hot stuff, and don't be gone too long.
That sound as desperate as I think it did?
Yeah, don't worry about it, you're a real Casanova.
Ronnie Earl's late.
I'm not waiting around for that loser.
The drinks are coming, relax.
I'm gonna go to the can.
If he ain't here by the time I get back, we're out of here.
- Right?
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh!
Sorry about that.
- What the fuck?
Disgusting.
What's up?
Jesus!
You motherfucker!
JIMMY:
I've been arrested 26 times.
I went to trial four times.
I got convicted twice.
Nowadays, what I'm doing, I just think of it as a business.
The people I work for are shit.
And the people I take out are worse.
I got some rules.
No women, no children.
Half the money in advance, and half when the job is done.
Don't trust anybody.
That's how you stay in the game.
And on this one, the game got rough.
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have one message.
Detective Kwon, McKay here.
The local PD has agreed to take you down to the morgue and show you Greely's body and personal effects.
Whatever got him killed, he must've been close to something sensitive.
We definitely need you to sort this out.
Since the case has the potential to get touchy with the feds, we want to maintain radio silence on the situation until you have some real answers.
Good luck.
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm looking for a Lieutenant Lebreton.
Yeah, he's right in that office.
Thank you.
LOLA:
I was in the shower for 30 minutes.
- LEBRETON:
Thirty minutes?
- About 30 minutes.
Lieutenant?
Hi, Detective Taylor Kwon.
I went to the hotel.
The client asked me to take a shower.
- And then those guys came.
- LEBRETON:
And what were they looking for?
They wanted my client.
They wanted to kill him.
That's what they came to do.
But I don't get a good look at them.
I can't identify them.
LEBRETON:
Two guys whacked him.
Looks like a drug deal gone bad, but the truth is, we don't know shit, so anything's possible.
They didn't kill the hooker that Greely was with.
These guys are pros, I don't know why they'd leave a witness.
That's her.
Russian.
I thought all the Russian hookers went to L.A., New York, or Vegas.
I get into the shower, I told you already.
LEBRETON:
Is this the first time you saw that client?
What do you know about Mr Greely?
Ex-WDCPD, Detective grade.
For about six months, he was my partner.
He was kicked off the force in complete disgrace.
Cop gone real bad.
Drunk, gambling.
He stole evidence from a case he was working.
- We still don't know what it was.
- (MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
- WOMAN:
Detective?
- Taylor here.
We ran Henry Hank Greely back through NCIC for recent known associates and came up with several reports of a possible relationship with local career criminal and protection racketeer Baby Jack Lemoyne.
- So far, that's it.
- Right, I'll check in later.
Who's this guy?
Louis Blanchard, local lowlife, hitman.
Somebody punched his ticket while he was drinking a beer.
- You got an estimated time?
- Just about midnight.
- DCPD.
- Yeah, it's Taylor here.
Yes, Detective?
Get me a speed check on a Louis Blanchard, local.
- Blanchard.
- Reputed hitman.
- Get me any known associates.
- Right.
Somebody took him out a couple hours after Greely last night.
Murder weapon was a five-inch blade with a three-inch curvature, mainly used for gutting animals.
The strikes were almost surgical.
Deflated both lungs, punctured the heart.
Detective Kwon, we've come up with two hits.
Louis Blanchard, 37 years old with a long list of priors.
Blanchard is a known associate of one James Bonomo, AKA Jimmy Bobo, suspected hitman, 26 arrests, two convictions.
I'll send you his current contact information via local parole board database.
- Right.
- That's all for now.
And thanks.
So this guy, Louis Blanchard, is a known associate of a James Bonomo, AKA Jimmy Bobo.
They worked together and they possibly fit the profile of Greely's killers.
Very good.
You get all that off your cell?
So I take it we're looking for this Jimmy Bobo?
My homicide division is more than capable of handling this matter, without your help.
You know, I think I'll stick around for a while.
Hold on.
You packing?
Bet you don't have a Crescent City carry permit, do you?
(PHONE RINGING)
JIMMY:
Nobody's here.
Leave a message.
Hello, Jimmy.
Name's Taylor Kwon.
I'm from out of state following up on the death of a Hank Greely, former associate of mine.
I think Louis Blanchard's murder ties into all this.
If you're interested in hearing some more, meet me at the St. Charles Saloon in three hours.
JIMMY:
It's easy to get sentimental about things.
Louis was a big boy.
He knew, he took his chances.
I worked with him the last six years, he never caused me a problem.
But still, we did our job and we got set up.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I need a rock glass.
You know, this is a bar, you can't bring in your own bottle.
You carry Bulleit Bourbon?
No.
Yeah, well, I do.
Here's 20 bucks to rent a glass.
All right.
Salud.
You're a cop, right?
Taylor Kwon, WDCPD.
Look, this isn't a sting.
I'm alone.
I wouldn't be here if you weren't.
So I figure you and Louis Blanchard take out Hank Greely last night.
Couple hours later, you walk into some type of double cross.
Louis goes down, you make it out.
The only part of this story I can't figure out is why you guys let the hooker live.
When I'm done with this drink, I'm gonna be done with you.
Hank Greely was an ex-cop.
Washington, D.C.
I'm on the case.
Look, I'm not really interested in some disposable hired hitter, no offence.
I want the guys who did the hiring.
You know, the same guys who took out your partner.
They probably held out on you.
Owe you some money?
Let's work together.
We can help each other out.
I don't work with cops.
Is that it?
That's it.
You change your mind, give me a call.
Why don't you have a drink for Louis?
That's probably the only thing you'll ever do for him.
(BRASS BAND PLAYING)
(GRUNTING)
Ahh!
They're cops.
Dead cops.
And you're gonna be dead, too, if you don't get in here and get fixed up.
Come on.
The cops are gonna be here any second.
They're gonna take your ass in.
Cops aren't gonna help you.
You clipped one of them.
Plus, you got another one laying over there somewhere.
And they're both rogue.
They're all not gonna be like that.
The pistol you used to kill that cop's got your fingerprints all over it.
You come with me and get fixed up, or you get out here and wait for the cops.
Your choice.
Make up your mind.
My fucking arm's getting tired.
Mr Keegan!
I'm told you had a bit of a problem last night.
A little unfinished business.
I'll find him.
BAPTISTE:
That scumbag Greely knew he needed some kind of insurance policy in order to blackmail us.
So he found Baby Jack and he gave him his evidence file for safekeeping, all of it proving that we paid off a congressman to steer a government contract our way.
We have an informant inside his crew.
He gave us the location of the file.
I want you to destroy it.
Okay, so, we are done.
Just keep this wrapped for 24 hours.
AD twice a day for a week.
Otherwise, no direct sunlight.
Keep it dry and absolutely no scratching.
- So what are we doing here?
- Getting matching tattoos.
Piss off, asshole.
Move your leg.
Piss off?
You came to me.
You asked me for help.
I thought about it and I said, "No."
Then I see all these guys trying to kill you, and I figure we're in the same boat.
But let's get something straight, either we do it my way or we don't do it at all!
Hey, Lisa.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.
I gotta talk to you a second, though.
It's been a while.
A girl gets lonely.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
- You know?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you, um, in trouble?
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
I need your help with something.
There's a guy out in the car.
He's been shot.
This guy's bleeding, I don't know how bad it is, but I can't take him to a real doctor.
Lisa, I gotta keep this one alive.
I told you before, I'm not in that business.
I never was.
This is the last time.
I'm sorry, I'll never do this again.
(GRUNTS)
Homicide, Lebreton.
Lieutenant, it's Detective Taylor Kwon.
Look, I'm still in Crescent City.
Yeah, well, you enjoying your vacation?
- This is a courtesy call, Lieutenant.
- Kwon.
I'm still working the Greely case until I hear otherwise from my boss.
Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me.
Did you find anything?
Yeah, I got a source.
He's gonna lead me to the guys who took out Greely.
I bring him in, he's just gonna lawyer up and then you got nothing.
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
I'll keep checking in.
No. This guy, no, he doesn't look like one of your usual lowlife buddies.
He's a cop.
I made the mistake of saving his life.
Well, that's a first.
Hmm.
All right, whatever, let's get him in.
TAYLOR:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What kind of doctor are you?
She did a year in med school.
It's the best you're gonna get.
Have some of this.
You'll thank me later.
TAYLOR:
Have you done this before?
- Yeah, a couple times.
- (MOANS)
(TAYLOR SHOUTING IN PAIN)
Gee, that's too bad.
Jimmy's friends occasionally have some problems.
I'm Lisa.
Taylor.
Taylor Kwon!
- (TAYLOR SCREAMING) - (CHUCKLES)
There it is.
Okay.
So, how'd this happen?
Did Jimmy do it?
He doesn't like cops very much.
Well, I don't like crooks very much.
(GRUNTS) The feeling's mutual.
You mind telling me why you're getting involved in this?
It's complicated.
Are you gonna arrest him?
Well, he's a criminal and a killer.
Yeah, who I guess saved your life.
It's just a scratch, right?
I still have to clean him up, stitch him up.
Then you can have him.
Give him a Band-Aid and a blow pop.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
We're closed.
Private club.
Just got some friends here.
Can I help you, buddy?
You looking for Baby Jack?
What the shit was that about?
- (GUN COCKING) - (MEN YELLING)
Open the safe.
Thank you.
Get the fuck out!
You're fucking dead!
(MAN GROANING)
This little number you pulled tonight may turn out to be the stuff of legend.
Mr Greely thought he was so smart to hide the file with an associate.
Job well done.
I had the advantage of surprise.
Your false modesty is apparent.
You enjoy your work.
(CHUCKLES)
Fascinating reading.
All the terrible things I've done.
But huge amounts of money can lead a man to temptation.
JIMMY:
I hear you're gonna live. TAYLOR:
Yeah, well, seven stitches.
Could have been worse.
Yeah, she said take these.
- What are they?
- Extract of white tiger juice.
Put a little pound in your pencil there, pal.
White tiger juice, my ass.
What about the good old "Asians Can't Drive" joke?
You guys can't drive, that's a fact.
No doubt about it.
So that tattoo doctor?
- Yeah.
- She seems okay.
Yeah, she's okay.
Kind of makes you an odd couple, huh?
Yeah, you trying to say something?
What?
Whatever, you know.
She chooses to be with you, you must be giving her something she needs.
Yeah, she's my daughter.
How'd you ever make detective?
You know that tattoo on your daughter's back?
It's very similar to the one on the hooker that was with Greely.
Don't tell me you're calling my daughter a hooker.
Don't even go there.
What I'm trying to say is that maybe the similar tattoos is why you didn't kill her.
It was some sentimental, dopey identification crap between, you know, her and your daughter.
What are you, a cop or a shrink?
So, who hired you to take out Greely?
In my line of work, we generally go through a handler.
This time, it was this jerk named Ronnie Earl.
You talk to this Earl yet?
No, I can't find him.
- What about you?
What do you got?
- (PHONE DIALLING)
- Well, so far, I got you.
- Great.
WOMAN:
DCPD.
Give me a speed check on a Ronnie, AKA Ronald Earl.
- Earl.
- Crescent City local.
- Right.
- Now you're doing your job.
You know, we'll figure this thing out, then we'll go get them.
Get them and what?
- Then take them out.
- No, you mean take them in.
Right, take them in. Whatever.
How am I supposed to trust you?
I don't know.
Why don't you read some fucking tea leaves?
That might work.
You know, I save your life, I get your wound fixed.
Now what do you want, a ring?
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
Yeah?
WOMAN:
DCPD, we got a Ronald Earl.
(SIGHS) Man, you're aggravating.
- Ronnie Earl AKA Cowboy Ronnie.
- Yeah, that's right.
Cowboy Ronnie.
35, born in El Paso.
Six feet tall.
- Right.
Where is he?
- Brown hair, blue eyes.
- Priors, grand theft auto...
- Car thief.
He's a scumbag.
Who gives a shit?
Where is he?
He was busted twice in Oklahoma City.
- Total loser.
- Illegal possession of firearms.
And we got a hit on his credit card at a place called Maison de Santé?
It's a Turkish bath house in the French Quarter?
I know exactly where it is.
- That's all for now.
- All right, thanks.
Yeah.
Let's go take a bath.
The Crescent City crime wave took an even more violent turn earlier this evening with the murder of Baby Jack Lemoyne and eight of his henchmen at their Algiers restaurant bar, The French Lick.
Lemoyne has long been considered a major racketeer in the Crescent City underworld scene.
Police suspect a rival gang in the Algiers area of committing the vicious murders and say it looked like an invasion of at least five assailants.
I'm Wanda Burton for Channel Two News.
He made a 10:00 appointment.
Charged an hour on his MasterCard.
JIMMY:
Hmm.
You're one of them phone guys, huh?
Yeah, I can't do my job without it.
You know, I could use this as a weapon?
I could jam your throat, hit your temple.
And, bang, you'd be toast.
And I just sit there, right?
Yeah, I could break this glass and use it as a cutting edge.
Never see me coming.
Or I could use the lithium battery to poison your drink.
You know, drop it in your coffee.
You won't even taste it.
And I can kill you with this piece of apple.
Yeah, right.
How would you do that?
Distraction.
(CHUCKLES)
Hmm?
This was Louis' knife.
Nice, huh?
You stay here and listen to the radio.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
That's bullshit.
I found him, I'm going in.
In my town, we'll do it my way.
Hey, you got 10 minutes, and then I'm coming...
Now I want you to sit over there and keep your mouth shut.
Forever, okay?
Forever.
RONNIE:
Are we gonna do this or what?
Sure, anytime.
You set me up, Ronnie, and you got Louis killed.
No. That ain't what happened, bro.
Why don't we just cut the bullshit, bro?
What about the client?
I never ask that shit.
You know that.
My guy hears from a guy who hears from a guy.
Who owes me money?
I don't know, but they owe me, too.
All right? I still haven't gotten paid.
What about Louis?
You set him up.
No way, Bobo.
Not a chance.
Louis was my boy.
Your boy.
Now, look.
That client took him out, I say we go find that fucker and get us both paid.
That's a good idea.
Why don't you get dressed?
(GUN CLICKING)
Guns don't kill people, bullets do.
You made two big mistakes.
You should have checked the weight, and you should have never tried to burn me.
- Baptiste.
- Mm-hmm.
All right, that's the brother's name, Marcus Baptiste!
He's a lawyer, and he's got an office down in the CBD, and he's got a big old fucking mansion in the Garden District, all right?
Baptiste.
How much for this to go away?
Give me a number.
Well, I was robbed, and Louis was clipped.
100 grand?
You know, Louis was a little oobatz, a little crazy, but I liked him.
I liked him a lot.
He was my partner.
All right, 500 grand!
Come on, that's a lot of cheese, but I could live with that!
I can't!
- Jimmy, no, no, no, no!
Jimmy, no!
- (GUN CLICKS)
Oh, my God!
Fuck!
No, no!
So, did you find Ronnie Earl?
- It's none of your business.
- Well, what did he say?
I got a problem with you.
- Don't touch my gun!
- (GROANS)
What the hell were you thinking, taking the firing pin out of my piece?
- Okay.
- Huh?
Okay, all right.
Maybe it was a mistake, all right?
- Mistake?
- Yeah.
But I'm a cop.
You know, I can't let you go on some fucking killing spree!
Yeah?
Well, it's gonna get worse.
If you can't handle it, go home!
Hey, fuck you!
You know, if it wasn't for me, you'd still be scratching your ass looking for Ronnie Earl.
If we're gonna find the guys that killed Louis and Greely, then we gotta work together on this!
You had me at "fuck you." Come on!
Next bum we gotta get is a lawyer named Marcus Baptiste.
I heard of him.
Seen his name in the paper, big shot type.
We'll see.
- DCPD.
- Yeah, it's Taylor Kwon.
Yes, Detective?
Get me a speed check on a Marcus Baptiste,
- local lawyer, ASAP.
- Baptiste.
- Right.
- All right, thanks.
(CHUCKLES)
What's so funny?
It's been a long time since I cracked out a cop.
- Bang, down, owned.
- Owned?
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
- It's Taylor here.
- DCPD regarding Marcus Baptiste.
There's a pen down there.
Marcus Baptiste, 5305 Britania.
- All right, got it, thanks.
- Great.
You were in the Navy, right?
- You were in demolitions?
- Yeah.
Early discharge.
No benefits.
Never did find enough evidence to court martial you for that C-4 you sold on the black market.
How do you know all that stuff?
With that phone?
Exactly.
I ran your file through NCIC.
High school dropout, military service, arrest record, prison time.
Yeah, you can find all of that on one of these.
May want to upgrade from carrier pigeons or whatever early man uses.
You gotta stop busting my chops.
And that C-4 case, someone else confessed to it, but I guess you ain't gonna find that on my records, are you?
You still did enough fucked up shit to spend the rest of your life in prison.
That ain't gonna happen, but I like your spirit, that Samurai thing, it's nice.
First of all, Samurai is Japanese, I'm Korean.
Got it.
That's like me saying my favourite Italian food are tacos.
That's kind of a stupid analogy.
(CROWD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING)
TAYLOR:
Wow.
Looks like Baptiste is having a party.
You know, costumes could work to our advantage.
Slip in and grab him where he can't make a scene.
Got it covered.
(ENGINE STARTS UP)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
- Hey, how are you?
- Hello.
We'd love for you to join us.
WOMAN:
Baptiste, wonderful party!
BAPTISTE:
Hey!
There you are.
I was just looking for you.
Why don't the two of you meet me in the back bedroom there, we'll play the fox and the hound together a little bit.
- TAYLOR:
That's our guy.
- Enjoy yourself.
Wait here.
BAPTISTE: Hey, kids!
Wonderful party, thank you!
Look at you!
Looking great, baby!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
(GROWLS)
- Come to me, princess.
- Fabulous.
Yes, baby.
Oh.
Ha-ha!
Darling!
- Easter Bunny, how's it going?
- Good to see you!
Gonna keep getting naughtier.
Keep getting crazier.
Gentlemen, despite the reverses and calamities of the recent past, we believe that this city still has a bright economic future.
What we're going to do is knock these ghetto housing projects flat and replace them with safe, modern, prestigious condominiums.
Ah.
Gentlemen, our host, Mr Baptiste.
Good evening.
Hope you gentlemen spend some time at the party.
Pleasure, pleasure.
To our potential success.
Cheers.
- MEN:
Cheers.
- Need anything?
A little privacy, right now.
And a little more whisky, if you can arrange it.
Gentlemen.
- Hey, Tiffany!
- Yes, Mr Baptiste?
- Morel wants some more whisky.
- All right.
- Hey, you know what?
Fuck him.
- Mr Baptiste.
Gonna piss in his cup.
Any drugs in here?
(BAPTISTE SINGING INDISTINCTLY)
JIMMY:
Grip it and zip it, party boy.
What the fuck is this, a joke?
Nah, it ain't no joke.
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
Yeah.
Meet me by the staircase at the rear of the house.
Okay, I'll be right there.
TAYLOR:
I thought you were just gonna talk to him.
I know, I know.
So, where are we going for this interrogation?
My hit-the-mattress joint, it's an old boathouse.
Hey, just don't give me any crap, I'm not in the mood right now.
What's your problem?
I saw the guy that killed Louis back at the party.
I wanted to take him out, but there's too many witnesses.
He's still out.
If he wakes up, just crack him.
What, are you kidding?
He's totally out.
Plus he's drunk, what's he gonna do?
Jesus Christ!
(HORNS HONKING)
Get off!
Nice going, Odd Job!
Good call.
You know, I give you one thing, one thing to do!
MOREL:
You let two unknown men enter this house uninvited.
Then you allow them to take the owner, and then, unmolested, they drive off into the middle of the night.
That's a little unfair.
Drunks walk in and out of these parties all the time.
Explain it to him.
TOWNE:
Would you take a look at this, please?
We're monitoring the GPS chip in Baptiste's phone.
As long as he has it with him, we can track him.
Extraction could be difficult.
Rescue operations have a marginal rate of success.
The most important thing is that we eliminate the kidnappers.
Everything else is secondary.
Including Mr Baptiste.
Is that clear?
TAYLOR:
Just let me handle the questioning, okay?
It's what I do for a living.
There's got to be a method to it, you know?
It's psychology, you get him to lower his guard.
One sentence at a time, build a rhythm.
It's a lot like music.
Break his fucking legs, he'll give you a Who concert.
Just let me handle it, okay?
(EXHALES)
That's got to be very uncomfortable.
Here we go.
Feel better?
That's good.
Now, you know, you're gonna talk to us, right?
That's a given.
And my associate here, he's a detective.
And he's gonna ask you some questions and you're gonna answer him.
Remember one thing, though. If you don't answer to him, you sure as hell are gonna talk to me.
Believe it.
You're on.
- Nice party.
- Thanks.
I don't remember sending you an invitation, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Oh, I did!
Great costumes.
Especially the ladies in their birthday suits, eh?
Don't worry about it.
I make sure they're all well-paid and well taken care of.
I bet you do.
Don't condescend to me, Kato.
- It says here you're a Chicago lawyer. - That's right.
Came here 15 years ago, passed the Louisiana Bar.
Specialised in real estate transactions.
Mr Hot Property, huh?
Thank God for Google.
Well, how does it feel knowing that you're going to get disbarred?
Disgraced in the press, serve hard time, lose every penny you've ever made.
How long have you been doing business with Ronnie Earl?
Never heard of him.
No, of course you have.
Come on, he hired two hit men who then murdered Hank Greely.
Ronnie Earl said that you did the hiring.
Yeah, that you paid the money.
You're a crook, Mr Baptiste.
You're an accomplice to murder.
Could we just end the charade?
Huh?
I know exactly who you two are.
This is where I live, this is now my city.
I am very highly connected.
You're dealing with people that are way up the ladder.
You'll never make any of this bullshit stick.
You want my advice?
You let me go and then run to the airport as fast as you and this dumbbell can get there.
All right, that's it, okay.
Hey, look, there's nothing you can do to me I haven't already done to myself for fun.
All right?
How you doing, tough guy?
You think he's comfortable?
Ow!
Fuck!
Okay, wait, wait, what do you want?
The tall guy that killed Louis.
- Tall guy.
Yeah, it's Keegan.
- Yeah?
What's his deal?
He's FFL.
Ex-mercenary, Central Africa, West Lebanon.
Now, he contracts out to Robert Nkomo Morel.
Why'd you set me and Louis up?
Morel didn't wanna take any chance that Greely's death could be traced back to us.
Greely was investigating Morel in DC.
Evidence of his payoffs to congressmen, senators, judges.
Thought he could blackmail Morel.
Didn't realise who he was fucking with.
That's it!
No more!
Hell, I don't want to get myself killed here.
I'm gonna blow your leg off.
Okay, I'll tell you about Morel.
He swindled a ton of money out of West Africa.
He started out buying up a lot of cheap real estate here in the city using other people's names.
Then he bribed his way into some big government contract to redevelop the area.
Look, I mean, this city is up for grabs, always has been.
We're just taking our share!
That's it!
This goes way up, man, we're talking about Washington.
You two are insane if you think that...
Okay!
Okay, okay, okay, okay, look.
It's around my neck, I copied Greely's whole life.
Names, dates, accounts, a little insurance policy in case Morel got clever.
- Fuck!
- TAYLOR:
It's a flash drive.
Look, you stupid motherfuckers aren't gonna get away with this.
Keegan's gonna punch your ticket, and I am gonna be there and I am gonna watch.
I'm gonna have a front row fucking seat.
You stupid and sloppy son of a bitch!
Are you fucking insane?
- You don't just kill a guy like that!
- I just did.
I'm playing by the rules.
Where you live, the rules are different.
All right?
He set me up, had my friend killed, took his chances and paid the price.
By the way, I know guys that would've done him real slow.
- When this is over...
- Oh.
You wanna do this dance?
- I won't have a have a choice, will I?
- No, you won't.
(GUNFIRE)
Hold!
Hold your fire!
Come on.
Check right!
- Check your six!
- I got a body!
(BEEPING)
Bomb!
Get the fuck out!
(SCREAMING)
A souvenir.
You're probably wondering why I happen to have my safe house all wired up.
Not really.
Like most criminals, you have a paranoid personality.
(SIGHS)
Here, take the keys and be quiet.
She's probably sleeping.
Oh!
What are you doing here?
Look, I'm sorry, you must have not heard us.
We were trying to be quiet, so we didn't wake you up.
I've been up all night.
I was just getting ready to go to bed.
Do you mind if I use your computer?
Oh, that's cute.
Anything interesting?
It's a list of names and payouts.
Oh, yeah, I recognise some of them.
Uh, that guy's a judge.
Some of the others, local politicians.
What's that folder?
Yeah, go up.
Those are money transfers.
Hey, we gotta find this guy, Robert Nkomo Morel.
Shouldn't be too hard.
JIMMY:
Yeah, figure out where the asshole is.
We keep moving up the ladder.
So, I was thinking that, you know, what you got going is interesting because I have always liked tattoos.
- And I think it's fascinating 'cause it's...
- It's just...
It's real.
Homicide, Lebreton.
Lieutenant, it's Detective Taylor Kwon.
Detective Kwon, how nice of you to find the time to check in.
Look, I think I broke this whole thing wide open.
There's this guy, Robert Nkomo Morel.
He was chased out of Africa one step one step ahead of prosecution.
I got this flash drive with a list of all the payouts.
As soon as I get back into town, you'll be the first person I call.
- JIMMY:
I told you I'd front you, didn't I?
- Nope.
No. I don't want to have to owe you.
You can make some real money.
You got a gift, use it before it passes by.
I'm serious.
Wow, that's great.
That's really great.
You're giving me career advice.
All right, forget it.
Bad or good, no good turn goes unpunished.
Tell the cop I'll be outside, okay?
You know, about Jimmy, you know I'll have to deal with him at some point.
You mean as a cop.
Yeah, as a cop.
All right, look, just cut him some slack, all right?
What if I told you he grew up on the streets, and then prison.
It's the only life he had.
Look, you know, I'm sure he's this brave as hell, very loyal...
But, you know, we're judged based on our actions.
He's done a lot of bad things.
I better go.
- What took you so long?
- I was saying goodbye to your daughter.
Hmm.
- Don't.
- Don't what?
- Just don't.
- Don't say goodbye, or...
Oh, don't go there.
Shit, it's none of my business.
Most of the time, she doesn't give a damn about me anyway.
I mean, she's all right.
Got a few issues, but what the hell, who doesn't, right?
- You been married?
- No, never tried it.
Yeah, me either.
So who's Lisa's mother?
Hooker junkie.
Dead 15 years.
So, you raised her.
No, I'm not a very good father, but I supported her.
She turned out to be a pretty good kid, considering.
TAYLOR:
When we get ashore, we gotta split up for a while.
There's someone I gotta go meet.
Who, you got a date?
It's a cop, he's from here.
I gotta go tell him what's going on.
So, what about this other guy, Morel?
He'll hire an army of lawyers, and fight the evidence on technical grounds.
But he's still going down.
Down.
Is that what you call it?
Down?
- Yeah, down.
- Down.
Six years at a country club jail, out in two, back in business.
That's not my idea of going down.
Going down is what happened to Louis.
All right, so you do what you gotta do, I'll handle things my way.
You know what, there is no your way!
Oh, here we go.
So much for trusting a cop.
- Yeah, you're under arrest.
- Am I really?
Okay, wanna do this dance again?
I tell you what, unless you're willing to pull that trigger and put a bullet to the head, that nine mill ain't gonna be much help.
Get out.
It's my car.
As soon as I take Morel down, I'm coming back for you!
I'll be waiting, Confucius.
I'll be waiting.
Amateur.
An amateur.
I'd like to talk to you about Mr Keegan.
I just talked to him.
I gave him some information I came up with.
Turns out the guy that we're looking for has a daughter.
Only child.
All the family he's got.
Well, that sounds very promising.
We'll let Mr Keegan mobilise, as he would say.
These psychotic paramilitaries he uses, they have a huge respect for him.
They see him as a hero.
He's got that perverted sense of honour, reckless sense of confrontation, they love that.
Well, that's very impressive, Detective, but I don't trust him.
He does what he does for reasons other than money.
Sir, I'd think very hard about this idea of termination.
He's a unique asset.
Never trust anyone who doesn't care enough about money.
You see, Mr Keegan fancies himself as a hero.
Well, guess what?
In classical literature, the hero dies.
Hey, how's it going?
Just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.
I need to talk to you.
Outside, please.
I can hear you fine in here.
Nothing's easy.
No!
All right.
Come here.
- You got here fast.
- Not much traffic.
Let's hear it.
Greely and Blanchard are victims of the same group.
The guy in charge is named Morel.
Greely found out about this in DC and came down here to blackmail him.
Yeah, I know the rest.
I told you to go home.
I know, I've heard the speech.
We should have taken him in.
You know, that still doesn't change anything.
You're welcome.
So, why'd you follow me?
I figured Morel had a few more cops in his pocket.
He was setting me up the whole time.
First they take out Greely, and then you and Louis.
He was there to make sure my investigation went nowhere.
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
Yeah.
KEEGAN: Hello, Jimbo.
You sound like you're having a nice day.
- Who's this?
- You lost your partner last time we met.
You and me, we've got a few things we need to work out.
Hey, hold on a second.
Someone wants to say hi.
- Speak. - Jimmy.
- They hurt you?
- No, not yet.
You got a good-looking girl.
I got a few ideas what I'd like to do with her.
Touch her and I'll kill you with a fucking rock!
- Come here.
- (GROANING)
This is simple.
We think you have something we want.
A flash drive.
Looks like I have something you want.
Okay.
(LISA WHIMPERING)
Don't hurt her.
Where you at?
Where are you?
KEEGAN:
Market Street Power Plant.
And don't come heavy.
If I see a piece, your daughter is gonna go right off the roof.
So what are we gonna do?
I want to get her back.
Give them what they want, then they die!
You shouldn't be here.
Oh, I think otherwise, Mr Keegan.
But don't worry about me.
Just worry about them.
Check him.
Make sure he's clean.
He's here.
He just rolled up.
TOWNE:
Jimmy Bobo's in the building.
Okay, Bobo.
Up the stairs, third floor.
Hey!
- Make a left.
- Fucking cave bear.
I'm gonna kill you.
Gentlemen.
No bickering, please.
We're here to do business.
I assume you brought what I want?
Yeah.
Where's my kid?
And where is your friend, the police officer?
Who gives a shit where he is?
That's your problem.
But you let me go and pay my fee, I'll hunt his ass down.
Fact.
Pay you a fee?
I don't believe I understand.
Understand what?
It's 500 grand, he's history.
And with that amount, you would sell your partner out?
Like that?
He ain't my partner.
He's a fucking cop.
Half a million seems a bit much, considering your circumstances.
Your bargaining position is very weak.
250.
Done.
Where's my daughter?
She's in the building, don't worry.
She's currently unharmed.
I wanna see Lisa.
You got a problem with that?
Are you guys fucking with me, or what?
MOREL:
No problem whatsoever.
Bring her in.
Wait a second.
Hey.
You don't have to do this.
When I want your opinion, I'll buy you a brain.
(GRUNTING)
Hey, let go of her! Hey!
Get your hands off of her!
Let go of her!
You hit her?
How about that.
I think she liked it.
MOREL:
Now, my friend.
The flash drive, please.
Thank you.
Very good.
We're back in business.
You can let her go.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I'd like this thing with the police officer done quickly.
Don't make me wait.
Let's get out of here.
LISA:
Where's Taylor?
He's all right.
MOREL:
Now, Detective Towne,
I want you to make sure that Mr Bobo and his daughter are safely escorted out of the building.
Yes, sir.
You don't seem to be very happy, Mr Keegan.
You're treating this Jimmy Bobo way too good.
Maybe you forgot.
Four of our operatives got killed by this guy last night.
You care about them?
Well, they're mercenaries like you.
They take their chances.
250 is as much as you paid me.
Well, Mr Bobo had leverage.
You don't.
I've got plenty of leverage.
Mr Towne.
All right.
Look, you don't have an argument with me!
This is my world!
Son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
How dare you?
I always knew never to trust a man who doesn't care about money!
TAYLOR:
Drop your weapon.
(GASPS)
- Get in there.
Get in!
- What?
Just get in there and stay down!
Stay down and sit back.
There he is!
Take him out!
- (GRUNTING) - (LISA SCREAMS)
Bitch!
Ready for another round?
I said I was gonna kill you.
Yeah.
It's kind of fun, isn't it?
Just you and me, two professionals.
Only one gets away.
Come on.
Look at that.
"Dedicated to the good men who battled the fire
"that took so many lives in the year of our Lord,
"1910."
Morel was gonna burn this place down and build a fucking shopping centre or some bullshit.
And all the poor bastards that saved this place, nobody's gonna remember who they were.
Nobody's gonna even remember what they saved.
Are we gonna fight, or you plan on boring me to death?
Come here, Jimmy.
What are we, fucking Vikings?
Pick it up.
There you go.
Pick it up!
I'm impressed.
Ohh.
Oh!
Oh.
Ouch.
You okay?
(LAUGHING)
Fuck!
(THUDDING)
I had it under control.
Yeah, bullshit.
You were history.
Call it even.
Keegan went rogue upstairs and killed Morel and the rest of them.
We still gotta sort out you and me, by the law.
The law.
You know, when it gets down to it, you're still just another chicken-shit cop.
Let's sort you out.
- (TAYLOR GRUNTS)
- No! No!
Come here.
LISA:
You son of a bitch!
I know, I know.
Listen up.
Keegan shot the guys upstairs.
Tell them I shot the rest.
You tried to stop me, and I shot you, too.
Make that your story.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Lisa, you coming, or you want to meet some more cops?
I'm gonna stay with him.
Right.
I'll be in touch.
Try not to move.
JIMMY:
I don't like cops.
You can't trust them.
Let me put it this way.
You can only trust them to be what they really are.
But this guy, Kwon, when he turned in his report, guess what?
He didn't rat me out.
When the news broke, the story was the bad guys got greedy, killed each other.
So I knew I must have stayed clean.
I don't know.
I guess Kwon figured he owed me.
Six weeks later, he sent me a message about maybe having a drink.
I thought I smelled a cop.
Guess who's late.
I read about you in the paper.
Looks like you're quite the hero.
Glad everything's working out okay for you.
Except for the two holes in my shoulder, two weeks in the hospital, and a month of rehab.
I'll be sure to repay the favour some day.
So that's what you came down here to tell me?
Actually, I came down to tell you a couple things.
All right, shoot.
First, I decided to get a tattoo.
Really?
Yeah.
Lisa came down to the hospital to visit me a lot.
At the hospital?
We got to know each other.
Mmm.
Actually, we got to really know each other.
Really know each other.
That's nice.
You know, I gotta be going.
Here's your fortune cookie.
I'm not gonna come after you for anything you did in the past.
But you break the law again and I hear about it, oh, you're going down.
That'll be the day.
Drinks on my buddy here.
Oh, shit.
That hurt?
JIMMY:
So that's the way it went down.
Nothing much changed except some people got killed that nobody's ever gonna miss.
And I ended up needing a new car, so I went out and bought myself a special ride.
Why not?
You don't live forever.

Man on radio:
Police in Northumberland have released information regarding the discovery of a body on the A1.
- OH, THE A1.
BOOM.
- They believe the victim is linked to a string of murders that have been happening...
- UH, TESTING.

( laughs )
WELL, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE SAME THING.
DETAILS.
THERE'S YOUR D.N.A.
I KNEW A GUY ONCE,
HE GOT HIRED ON FOR A JOB.
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A SIMPLE JOB,
BUT AT A TENSE MOMENT, HE LICKED HIS LIPS.
- THAT'S ALL IT TOOK.
- ( gunshot )
THEY GOT HIS D.N.A. FROM SALIVA ON HIS SKI MASK.
WITH THAT, THEY COULD PUT HIM AT THE JOB.
AND IF THEY COULD PUT HIM AT THE JOB, THEN THEY COULD PUT OTHER PEOPLE AT THE JOB.
- SO THAT WAS THAT.
- WHAT, THEY DID HIM IN?
Roy:
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
FOR A GUY TO GET ALONG IN THIS WORLD,
HE HAS TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL.
- SAME GOES WITH YOUR DAD.
- NO, HE'S NOT MY DAD.
WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM THEN?
THE GUY THAT SCREWS YOUR MOM?

SHOUT "ROVER."

IT'S JUST NOT VERY BELIEVABLE,
GUY LIKE ME WITH A DOG CALLED ROVER.
ALL RIGHT, YOU CHOOSE A NAME.

Roy:
WE KNOW YOUR LIFE'S BEEN THREATENED.
WE THINK YOU MIGHT BE #4, DANIL.
CAN I CALL YOU DANIL?
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
WE WANT TO TAKE YOU INTO PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT AND TALK TO ME?

NO NO NO NO NO.
NO NO, HE'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE JUST ANOTHER VICTIM,

( breathes deeply )
SO JUST HERE.
ALL RIGHT?
ON YOU GO.
( sniffles )
SEE ON HIS HAND?
LOOK, IT SAYS "MATE."
Roy:
NO, IT DOESN'T SAY "MATE."
IT SAYS "MOM" AND "DAD" IN LATVIAN.
- LATVIAN?
- THAT'S WHAT THEY SPEAK IN LATVIA.
ARE YOU GONNA DO THIS OR WHAT?
( breathing heavily )
TRY NOT TO LOOK IN HIS EYES,
SO YOU DON'T IDENTIFY WITH HIM.
WELL, IT'S A BIT ODD NOT TO.
WELL... ( sighs )
THINK...
OF SOMETHING THAT YOU HATE.

IT WAS 'CAUSE I FANCIED HER.
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T DO IT.
YOU'VE GOT A SECOND CHANCE.
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.
SO MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND TRIES TO GET ME KILLED,

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
The magical crown jewels at the bottom of the mystery cave.
That's great.
How do you get in?
Oh, no!
Guys!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Pink, you're a wizard!
Quick!
Come in here!
Follow me!
Trixie, Pink, hurry up!
Oh, no!
Okay, guys, you might remember last week...
I gave that great lecture on Elvis Presley and the 1950s... but today we have to change gears and talk about something... that's a little bit deeper, a little harder to get at... which is the Civil Rights Movement, or the black freedom struggle... or what some historians have called the second reconstruction.
Which I really like because it ties it to the first reconstruction after the Civil War... to show that there is a continuum... there is a constant struggle on the part of African-Americans in the South... to claim their freedom, their liberty.
And without a doubt...
World War ll really provides the fuel for this... that when you go overseas to fight Hitler... you get shot at, you see your friends killed... you're gonna come home a different person.
You're gonna come back a radicalized individual... willing to risk life and limb.
So the Double V campaign during the war is quite interesting.
It stood for victory at home and victory abroad.
Defeat Hitler and fascism and its racist policies... but also defeat Jim Crow and the racist South.
And they tried to do that, but they needed some help... and without question, in one of the most important-
I can feel - I can feel the presence of almighty God in this room.
- Yes!
- Oh!
The swagger is coming all upon us, isn't it?
Ooh!
Oh, yeah.
Crazy Keith.
Are you crazy for jesus?
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Are you jacked up on Jesus?
- Mm-hmm.
I am.
I am!
- I'm feeling the almighty jesus in this room.
- All right!
Are you all hearing me?
Let's all rise.
Let's all rise and get a good "amen."
- Amen?
- Amen!
- Amen!
- Amen!
Praise God.
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen Amen, amen
In closing, we're gonna read one more verse.
I'm gonna read from I Corinthians 10:13.
It says, "But when you are tempted... he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it."
- How cool is that?
- Right.
- Dudes, how cool is that?
- It's awesome.
Do you feel what that says?
That e very temptation he '5 gonna give you a way out.
- Y'all feel me?
- Yeah!
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!
Let's close in a word of prayer.
Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for bringing me... into the presence of these wonderful young Christians... to discuss and talk about temptation... to talk about Satan.
Hey, you going to Florida?
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- Who you going with?
- Brit and Candy and Cotty.
- Be careful.
- Why?
- Those girls are scary.
- No.
- Especially Brit and Candy.
Why do y'all say that?
'Cause they're just so cold.
They act like they got demon blood.
They're evil.
They give me the freakin' chill bumps.
Yeah.
No, I've known them since kindergarten.
- They're sweet.
- They don't seem right.
- I hope you pray down there in Florida.
- Pray hard-core.
Pray super hard-core.
He's so fucking high!
Yeah!
Hit that baby!
Numbers!
Come on, come on!
Bounces!
Whoo!

Good morning, sunshine.

What do y'all want?

- Come on, Faith.
Wake up.

I'm up!
What time is it?

We need your money.

We're not even, like, halfway to spring break, y'all.
Fuck.
That won't even get us one night's hotel room down there.
- I have another 20 in my purse.
- Faith.
Faith.
Do you know how expensive that place is?
So tired of seeing the same things every single day.
Everybody's miserable here because everybody sees the same things.
They wake up in the same bed, the same houses... same depressing streetlights... one gas station.
The grass, it's not even green.
It's brown.
Everything is the same, and everyone's just sad.
I don't want to end up like them.
I really want to get out of here.
This is more than just spring break.
This is our chance to see something different.
Everybody else already left.
Yeah, everyone's gone.
We're the only ones still here.
We fucking suck.
We're leaving, you guys.
We're not gonna be stuck here.
We 're not gonna be the only ones here.
We've been stuck here.
We've been saving this money since the beginning of the year.
Well, we'll figure a way out to get more.
How are we going to - How are we gonna get enough money in time?
I don't know.
All I know is I'm not gonna sit here another day.
I'm not gonna sit in the same fucking classroom.
We 're not gonna be miserable.
We 're getting out of here.
- What's up, homes?
- What's up?
Um, can we use your car?
No.
- Why?
- It's in the shop.
- Why?
- Do you know anyone else's car that we can use?
' Shady!
' Do you?
No.
- Come on, Cotty.
- Everyone's pretty much gone.
You know where Professor Stevens keeps his car, don't you?
- The El Camino?
- Yes.
I know where he hides the keys.
- Of course you do.
- Fuck you.
Why?
What are you up to?
Don't worry.
Yo, we can do this.
I know we can.
just fucking pretend like it's a video game.
Act like you're in a movie or something.
We can do this.
You can't be scared of shit.
- But you gotta be hard.
- Fuck that.
Don't be scared of nothin'.
Let's just get that fucking cash and go on spring break.
just pretend it's a fucking video game.
Act like you're in a movie or something.
You can't be scared of shit.
You have to be hard.
Don't be scared of anything.
Let's just get this fucking money and go on spring break, y'all.
Fuck yeah.
Let's fucking do it.

Move!
Go!
Go!
Whoo!
Look.

With squirt guns.
- Are you serious?
- With squirt guns!
We did it.
We pulled it off.
We really fucking pulled it off.
- It was fucking awesome.
- Oh, my God.
Hey.
Spring break.
- Mmm?

Suck.
Okay!

Seeing all this money makes my pussy wet.

We saw some beautiful things here.
God, I can't believe how many new friends we made.
Friends from all over the place.
I mean, everyone was so sweet here.
So warm and friendly.
It's way more than just having a good time.
God, it was so nice to get a break from reality for a little while.
I'll always remember this trip.
I wanna come back again next year with you.
Something so amazing, magical.
Something so beautiful.
Feels as if the world is perfect.
Like it's never gonna end.
Yeah!
Are you ready?

That'd be real cool, Faith.
Really cool.
I'm not drunk enough for that.
That'd be, like, really cool.
"So cool, y'all."
Are y'all making fun of me?

We just want to click things and freeze them.
And buy houses together and go to church services and pray.

Get in the car.
Faith?
Faith, it's okay.
Why is this happening?
This isn't supposed to happen.
I don't understand.
We were just having fun.
We didn't do anything wrong.
This is where we were supposed to find ourselves.
This is where we were supposed to find who we are.
Why did this happen?
This wasn't the dream.
It's not supposed to end this way.
It can't end this way.
It can't end this way.
This is where we were gonna be forever.
This isn't the end.
This can't be the end of the dream.
Yo, fuck you, man!
Let's go.
Now let me guess.
Spring breakers?
You're not gonna be charged with a narcotics possession... 'cause it wasn't found on your actual person.
You will be issued citations... but you're gonna have to pay the fines or you're gonna do two more clays in county.
We're gonna be in so much trouble.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
But you are gonna be issued citations.
You're gonna have to pay the fine, or you can do two more clays in county.
We don't have any money.
Call mommy or daddy or do the time.
Spring break is not an invitation to do drugs or commit crimes.
Thank you.
Have fun, girls.
Somebody loves y'all.
You're free to go.

I ain't from this planet, y'all.
Alien?
That's what they call me.
- Why are you here?
- I saw y'all in there.
Looked like nice people.
Thought maybe I'd bail you out.
Everyone can use a little bailing out once in a while.
Why?
Why not?
Come on, y'all.
Why you acting 'spicious?

We can go wherever you all want.

It's the time to experiment.
You met the twins?
Now, you got to watch out for these twins.
You know, they do everything together.
They eat together, they sleep together, and they share their women.
You know what they're all about, do you?
Double penetration.
That's how they do it.
Ain't that right?
Calm down over there.

Yo, let Faith shoot.
Faith, go!

I don't like it here.
This is just too weird.
This is not what we came here for.
We came here to have fun, and we came here to party.
It is fun.
- Why are you crying?
- This is not what it was supposed to be.
It's not fair to me because this is not what I signed up for... and I'm very uncomfortable.
I don't know these people.
And we were in jail.
And this guy that I don't even know checks us out of the jail... and then says all this weird stuff... and brings us here with these people... like, touching us and talking to us... and I don't know them, and I don't feel comfortable.
I want to go home.
This is not what I signed up for.
Maybe.
I don't like it here.
Please just take me home.
- Come on.just come with me.
- I just-
Come on. We gon' party.
Stop actin' scared.
It's okay, Faith.
Faith, we're not gonna let anything happen to you.
All right?
It's okay.
Can I talk to you?
You all right?
What's wrong?
I just - I want to go home.
Why?
You upset?
- I don't like it here.
- Why?
What's wrong?
This isn't why we came here.
Why'd you come here?
I don't like where we're from... so I thought that if we came here that we could... be free or just have fun.
Okay. isn't that what we're doing?
Ain't we having fun?
No.
What kind of fun did you want to have?
- Not going to jail.
- Well, you're out of jail now.
I didn't get you in jail.
I got you out of jail.
So don't put that on me.
I don't know you.
All right.
And?
I don't know what you want with me and my friends... but you should leave us alone.

I ain't gonna do nothin' to hurt you.
Don't you see that?
If you want to go home, you can go home.
But then you're just gonna be home.
Just gonna be back right where you started.
And you'll be thinking...
"Hmm.
Maybe I missed something out there."
You want to go?
Why?
Why?
Why you so upset?
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

Some kids-
Some little kids- they want to grow up to be president.
Some kids want to be a doctor.
You know, I just wanted to be bad.
They kicked me out of school.
I thought that was great.
Shit, I don't have to go to your school.
That was the best thing in the world.
Some people- they want to do the right thing.
I like doing the wrong thing.
Everyone's always telling me, "Yo, you gotta change."
I'm about stacking change, y'all.
Stacking change.
That's it- money.
I'm about making money.
That's the dream, y'all.
That's the American dream.
That's it.
I did it.
Most of my brothers and sisters- they dead.
It was all bad.
They got murdered.

You was my best friend.
Yeah, you took me to the ocean that one time.
That's the only time I've ever been.
Yeah.

You got your own operation.
You slick, and I don't like that shit.
What you want me to do?
You want me to stay in your shadow for the rest of my life?
I want you to buy a fuckin' surfboard and go back in the middle of the ocean and disappear.
Go back to doing what white boys do, like robbing spring breakers... hide down the board-walk like we did when we was kids.
Sounds to me like someone's getting greedy.
Sounds to me like somebody's getting pissed.
You saying there ain't enough to go around?
Fuck no.
You know I own these streets.
So you can handle all this on your own?
- You think you can handle it?

Anything you can handle, I can handle.
Just like I made you, I'm gonna break you.

Look at these titties and look at that ass.
Come here, puss.
Damn, baby.
Feel like you're playing piano on my dick.
Like you're playing Mozart.
Hey, Mom.
I'm good.
Yeah, I've actually been thinking a lot lately.
I just want to do better.
Better at school, better at life.
I just feel different for some reason.
I feel changed, like I just want to be a good girl now.
I mean, I want to be happy and have fun.
Yeah, Mommy, I think that's the secret to life.
Being a good person.
Hi, Mom, it's Candy.
I'm sorry I haven't called in so long.
I know.
No, I know, I know.
No, I apologize.
Yeah.
Look, urn, we went on spring break.
Yeah.
It was so much fun.
You have no idea, Mom.
We had such an amazing time.
It was a blast.
Listen, I just wanted to let you know that I'm coming home... back to school and everything, and I just-
I love you so much, Mom.
And I'm gonna do better now.
I'm gonna be the best I can be.
That's it, baby.

Yeah, make it all sparkle.
Get it squeaky clean for me.
Seems like a dream.
Seems like a dream.
Seems like a dream.
Yeah, Mom, it was really great.
I think we found ourselves here.
We finally got to see some other parts of the world.
Yeah, we saw some beautiful things here.
Things we'll never forget.
We got to let loose.
God, I can't believe how many new friends we made.
Friends from all over the place.
I mean, everyone was so sweet here.
So warm and friendly.
I know we made friends that will last us a lifetime.
We met people who are just like us.
People just the same as us.
Everyone was just trying to find themselves.
It was way more than just having a good time.
We're different people now.
We see things differently.
More colors, more love, more understanding.
God, it was so nice to get a break from reality for a little while.
I know we have to go back to school, but... we'll always remember this trip.
Something so amazing.
Magical.
Something so beautiful.
Feels as if the world is perfect.
Like it's never gonna end.
At night here, we can see way past the stars.
We - We can see into the light.
And it's just - Oh, it's beautiful.
I never want it to end.
Spring break forever.
Spring break forever, bitches.
Spring break forever.

- What do you say?
- What are you waiting for?
Kill me!
Is that what you want?
Suck on the money.
Present, Rome.
- Have you been married, Davide?
- No, but I have a girlfriend.
- Her name is Elena.
- Do you love her?
Yes, very much.
She pulled with my boss.
- Do you mean that she ran off with him?
- More or less.
There are women who wants a happy family as in fairy tales and then there are those who suffer "bossyndromet".
I was no boss.
- Is she still with him?
- He died Like a sewer rat.
It was during the Mafia war, right?
Yes, there were many people killed.
There were so many that can not count them.
There were those who wanted have a happy family.
Come on, let's go home.
Fuck you, you fucking devil!
Do not waste the swearing unnecessarily.
It is usually never someone who cares.
Thank you.
- "Do you speak" English?
- Not so good.
Are you American?
San Francisco.
Davide...
- Father Leonard.
- Father Leonard?
Is that true?
I was recently ordained.
I'm not so used to it all yet.
Have you just gotten Priest?
And now...
And now you do not...
- Do you like it?
- No, no, no.
Do not misunderstand me.
I had to do it.
I want to serve Jesus.
I have a past full of plagues - and brutality, and the...
Sometimes I wonder who I am to act as So righteous and inflated devoutly And believe that everything I do is for good.
Is it to escape there past like you are in Italy?
I was not a good Christian in San Francisco.
I was not at all good.
My life was about to rob Mistreat vandalize.
I thought that violence was only way to get what you wanted.
But then something happened.
I had done something terrible And fled to the church to hide.
You came in faith to me.
Suddenly I was overwhelmed by a desire to leave it all behind me And become a priest in a foreign country.
Here I am.
- Were you alone?
- No, I started the thread.
Then I got older and more powerful.
I could do no wrong.
I was the leader.
How long have you lived in Rome?
For two years and then gave I of two years.
The American woman sitting a few seats from us.
She saw her husband murdered for years ago- and she has not yet found peace.
I ran into her in Rome.
I knew she was looking for me.
And somehow I was looking for her.
She has haunted me ever since.
As if I had any answers.
We are plagued all of our Past.
God, was not it amazing?
He ​​is so romantic.
Tony looks really good.
Lily should return to Italy.
Every summer used William and his brother spend time with their dad's family in Tuscany.
- Sure did you do it?
- And you came every other weekend.
You spent a few days with my father and then disappeared to the Milan to shop.
Your father inherited their money.
I had to work for mine.
It's really true.
It is not easy to keep up with her.
She was a waitress when she met him on a business trip.
He, however, fell directly on her.
Look at her features.
He lent her money for to start a business.
Assecoarbolaget she started had a very popular handbag.
Everyone was as crazy about it.
She came into vogue.
Donna Karen was a fan.
The money he got back on a six months and then he married her.
Smart guy.
She served soon more money than he.
Not really.
He was my anchor.
It is said that behind every great woman is a great man.
- So true.
- Is not it the opposite?
It works both ways.
I have two exceptional women in my life.
Is why I am so successful.
I need the toilet.
I'll see you here later.
My goodness, do not forget we are just.
Another goofy evening with your socialite mom and your streberfru.
Keep them outside.
They have nothing with my business to do.
Your mother sits on the board of the museum.
You could easily have moved stuff to her inflated friends.
Everything that we worked with in the past should stay in the past.
My mom has always worked so much .
She did not know what I did.
So I helped you.
We made a lot.
I'm not too proud of it.
And my wife, Deborah See everything that happens.
She is way too smart and asks too many questions.
He has been with me on the boat.
I would have told the truth?
That you blew a guy.
That you manipulated and blackmailed him to come out of it.
I got this shit from Italy on the ship.
You say, "calm".
"Do not worry. It disappears when we become rich."
You have the right connections.
Your mom might even buy it.
I've paid a lot for this.
Should I keep the bag too?
We need to go back.
You did not even have a ticket.
What are you doing here?
This will never work.
My life has changed.
Everything can be traced nowadays.
It's not like the old where when there was internet.
I can not risk revealed.
My father is dead.
He was the only one who could protect me...
and you and us.
Now must myself take care of family business.
My wife is a smart chick.
She sees everything.
She wants to focus on policy, and nothing will stop her.
I have changed.
That's why I asked you to marry you with a young and stupid chick.
Then you would not need to worry.
Do not tell me what to do.
You always do.
Should you decide who I marry?
Should you decide who to be my mom?
Get a life and leave my life alone.
Stop pop up everywhere and haunt me like a stalker.
As weeds that refuse to extinction.
Maybe you like to be eradicated.
Okay...
- Antonio...
- How nice to meet you.
- Bravo.
- You were absolutely wonderful.
Thank you for your compliments.
I'm sorry your dad's passing.
I grew up with him in Tuscany.
I could always rely on you for taking care of my man- and teach him to be a real hireling.
I'm glad you did not take after him.
We will soon return to Italy.
He ​​must visit us then.
Now he dressed.
The guest of honor Do not be late to his own party.
- Ciao.
- Thank you for coming.
You were absolutely wonderful.
Girls, I know Italians like to eat late.
But you know it's not fits my stomach.
We'll let the ladies have some nice.
- Meet me here at one o'clock, James.
- Turn around so I can see you.
No, no, no.
Why will not you talk to the woman?
I do not know if I have that she is looking for.
It was a good answer.
If at all there is something answers.
I did Sicily the same reasons.
I left everything behind me, but some sins can not erase.
I know, but all sins can be forgiven.
Do not talk nonsense.
Sins can not be forgiven without...
- Without compensation?
- Yes.
Indemnity is the word.
I left Sicily because I thought I already atoned for my sins.
It was just bullshit.
Four years earlier, Sicily.
Do you understand, Vito?
If we do the job , we are on the dry in two or three years.
- I can give mom some money.
- But it is dangerous.
- Bullshit.
- Are we invited?
Do not you know that by marriage, funerals and confession are all welcome.
I had forgotten.
- Where do we work?
- Have a little patience.
Now we go and celebrate the newlyweds.
Why did you hit me? Don Michele, I took freedom to look you up because I would like to work with you .
Work for Me?
What would you do?
Anything, as long as it is lots of easy money.
Easy money.
Sana money does not exist.
Get a job.
Are you good at tiling?
Can you paint?
Can you repair an engine?
Fuck completely in that kind of job.
I want a job where I earn lots of money.
You can sell drugs.
Be careful, once you are inside in the family, you will not like.
Your life belongs to me then.
Come on.
See you tomorrow.
- Want some?
- Yes.
You are like a son to me, Tony.
I have known you since you were six.
After your father's death took I care about you.
And now you're one of the my most reliable men.
I would never hurt you.
I know.
I never doubted.
Mancino is on the way to Sicily.
It does not feel to my existence here.
They must believe that he is the godfather.
Above all, they should not feel to my step-brother's existence.
- Who is it?
- His name is Davide.
Davide Spicuzza.
He's an asshole and a total disaster.
I should have killed him before I came here.
It's never too late.
It can still do.
No, it's not the right time.
I knew you would not disappoint me.
What are you talking about?
Are you kidding?
Do you see how beautiful the country is?
I am blessed.
I do not I am from this country.
I have promised to bring me my mom again.
But not until I cleared it.
And then came the assholes...
The fucking bastards Came to Chicago To silence me.
Silencing me.
Silent Me...
Seven years...
- That's correct, sir.
- Seven years.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
What they got out of it? Nothing.
What will they get?
Nothing.
They do not deserve it.
I deserve it.
My family deserves it.
What should they do?
Challenge Me?
Okay, okay.
Okay, shoot then!
Slide then!
No...
Do you know why?
Because they are weak and stupid.
Their men grabbing.
Their businesses will suffer.
They do not have time to shoot my guys.
Had they been smart had shot me.
You make me never disappointed.
What would you have us do?
I want my city.
It's what I want.
It's time to infiltrate Cortellos.
Var mites.
Sleep with them.
Fuck with them, Fuck them.
Find out what they like to eat, what they hate and what they love what they care about, what they think, what they do not care .
Find their weakness.
Remember the Trojan Horse?
Very clever.
It's something like that I need.
A horse gift.
Anything that gets the bastard.
When we find their weakness...
Then it ended.
Do you understand?
Crystal clear, sir.
Totally and completely.
Do not do everything.
Leave something to me.
Sicily.
It is not good for you to go.
It is killing us all.
Good morning, Don Michele.
- Today, make a new job.
- I am available.
This is a robbery at Cascino, jeweler.
I've got a tip.
They have taken received diamonds from South Africa.
How much do I get out of it?
1000 euros for each stone.
1000 euros for each stone.
It's okay.
- Okay, we'll see.
- Have a good day.
By the way...

- What did that man?
There should not you think about, Mary.
Go up and cook some food.
Do you understand the situation?
We had not anticipated the reaction.
None should be questioning our way of doing business.
From tomorrow we may be a little more cautious.
Either way, there exists the problem.
We have to get rid of quickly.
We need to kill bagaribossen.
We have to do it tomorrow.
Bakery Bossen.
It's always nice to purify the mind.
I had not made the journey without someone to talk to.
Tell us something more about the woman.
She looks at me.
She might want to talk to you.
I met a priest once.
He ​​was your opposite.
- In Rome?
- No, that was before Rome.
His name was Father Carlo.
- Where are you from?
- Palermo.
My dad marched through Palermo during WWII.
The liberated Palermo, Messina, Trapani, Agrigento, Siracusa. all of Sicily.
We were there on vacation when we were kids.
I have never had so much fun.
I love Syracuse.
I love Sicily.
I think it's the most beautiful place.
- That's a little excessive?
- You think I exaggerate?
Do you know that Goethe felt the same thing.
- He said the same thing I did.
- Author? I know of him.
Yes, writer, philosopher, scientist .
One of history's greatest thinkers.
You can see Italy, but you have not seen Sicily Then you have not seen Italy.
Sicily is the clue to everything.
He studied art, antiques, architecture.
He traveled to Palermo and explored Plants and flowers perfect artarketyper.
Jeez what I have traveled.
I am Father Karl and you are Davide.
Yes, I'm Davide.
Yes, but it's you who made me to understand why I'm here.
I have an internal problem, I have to solve.
Do you know what I think?
I do not think you get any worries with a stay here.
I think you'll to like it.
Leave the world behind you.
You will find peace here.
The only one I pray for is that you trust me.
It's not about trust, brother Carlo.
This is about safety for my life and for yours.
You will not find a safer place.
Here you are protected by the San Sebastian and by me.
I always listen to talk-
Or if you choose to confess.
I am curious and have always been fascinated by people.
I know that you are a sincere and honest man
-who might just have had some bad luck.
Here you are safe and you will find peace.
We have much work to do.
I believe you can do it.
- Thank you.
I needed this really.
- Need a little color here.
What would you do if you been in my shoes?
Tell your story, Leonard.
I started fishing in San Francisco Bay.
Because I was tall.
When did you become a höjdarfiskare.
Did you do it before or after you ruined my life?
I asked, did you go fishing Before or after...?
What do you mean?
Money for the boat?
Where did you get them from?
Ah...
Debra...
Not so fast...
How dare you you to address me by my first name?
- Mrs. Lewis...
- I am a widow Lewis, remember?
You always thought you were right...
You did not.
And that you will never have.
Look at this.
See for yourself.
See how you look.
Flees you?
I... ask You, God...
- Are you new?
- Do not move!
I...
Dear God, please forgive me.
Your cowardly wretch.
You may recognize me Yet dared you come and talk to me.
Do not have a dick?
We know you've got the balls to kill another human being.
Especially if there was money in it.
Come on, do it.
Do it.
Do it!
How much you got out of it?
Where is it?
Did you sell it?
Time I gave him?
- Did you sell it?
- Our Father...
Now he asks!
Is he listening to you?
God listen to you?
Where was he when I needed him?
What would you have me do?
Please, say something.
What would you...
What can I do?
What do you expect from me?
I want you to be condemned...
And that it is God's will.
I do not understand.
I want you to do something good of your life.
I want his death to be have a meaning.
Do what you do now.
I want you to earn his forgiveness.
I'll collect his courage.
I swear I'll tear you to pieces with my bare hands.
Do you have something more to say, priest?
I have nothing more to say.
I...
I understand everything.
I understand that we all looking for the same thing.
- The show is over.
- Oh, thank God.
Did you really kill him?
Ja...
I did.
Poor woman.
You recognize my story, Davide.
It has been a rewarding journey.
- I regret only one thing.
- Yet?
I will not be able listen to your story.
Excuse me for asking, Don Miche.
What is this place?
Do not worry.
You look worried.
We'll sort out something.
I'm not worried, but this place makes me nervous.
I want to tell you something.
I have a friend named Vito.
We used to work together.
He ​​is a smart and good guy.
He asked me to speak to you, if he could join the family.
- With your permission of course.
- No problem.
- Are you a benefactor, Don Miche?
- Think about what you say.
Take him you.
Sooner or later I put him to the test.
- What kind of job is it?
- You should fix one said.
- Yes, but what?
- You ask too much.
If you pass the test, you are a member.
- Here we go.
It's just time.
- Time for what?
You must do something for me.
Come on now.
Davide?
Come out.
- Cut his throat or shoot.
- Are you kidding, Don Michele?
- Who is he?
- A fanatical American.
No problem, Don Miche.
- You talk American?
- A little.
Hey, John Nino.
Hi, Johnny.
John, calm down.
Come on, Johnny.
Go away.
Stick with you.
Right, go now!
What happened?
What are you doing?
Is it possible?
You fucked up even though he was bound!
I fucked up at all.
I understood that you put me to the test-
- Then I saw him in the eye.
I felt sorry for him.
In the family there are no feelings like that.
Being lawlessness is okay, but to be killer...
Why is that?
Okay, that's fine.
This time I let it be but from now on you know nothing about what happens in the family.
Tomorrow I meet your friend Vito anyway.
We'll see what he can do.
Get out now.
Goodbye, Don Miche.
- Where is he?
- Who?
- The man who escaped.
- Stop, Go away now.
- What do you mean?
- That you will pull.
Otherwise you will annoy me all day.
Get out of my house.
- What the hell have you done?
- I was at the jeweler and nobody came.
- You should have killed the bastard.
- Gun clicked.
It was uncharged, you idiot.
You are lucky.
Today I'm in a good mood.
But I do not like to speak with police.
You might even go into my house.
- You should be grateful, right?
- Thank you very much.
I've been watching you for a while, and found that you are an asset.
Look at me.
Starting today, you member of the family.
Well done.
Why did you want to join us?
Out of respect... and distresses.
My mother is alone and I has two younger brothers.
Bravo.
I like you.
You take care of your family.
Family is very important.
Honor, respect and family.
It is as if we where an American film.
And the guy...
I'll give you an offer you can not say no to.
Listen Franco.
We need help a friend from Trapani to Rome.
Calabrese, formerly dealt with apartments.
Now he deals with drugs, weapons.
They have political patronage- and until someone in the police force.
Banda della Magliani is back.
And Casalesi behave like assholes.
- We have to do something about it.
- I can go there if you want.
- I need you to others.
- I send Peppuccio.
He is merciless and he's already people in the area.
The other problem then?
Davide...
He's a good guy, but he has no stake.
He's weak.
According to me he is useless unlike his friend Vito.
- They are sloppy.
Two petty thieves.
- Vito is a man.
He has been married to flowing into your eyes.
You must keep an eye on Vito.
He can take care of something simple, a club, or the like.
From now on, so keep I an eye on him.
By the way, he talks way too much for by priests.
Post by?
Is he more Catholic than my mom?
- How's business?
- Good, you can ask the cashier about it.
There was no specific question.
I want to know if you feel comfortable with us.
- Yes, everything is going well.
- Good.
Then I am satisfied.
I met your friend Vito.
I like him.
He ​​is already a member of the family.
He is upright.
He ​​also has the ability to kill.
Thank you for giving me the this opportunity.
I am also happy for Vito's sake.
Now he can work and earn money.
He will help you in suburbs and downtown.
In the suburbs?
As you wish, Don Miche.
Okay, Davide.
We have problems with some shopkeeper who did not want to pay.
Ya.
Satan American.
He started run things in Palermo.
It's that time of Toto Riina and Carleonesi.
You start you do not do those vitamins.
Vito has always been responsive.
But what you do not know Vito is that we got a lot of shit of this Mancino.
- What about New York?
- We do not ask for help yet.
But we must act and think as in the past.
We need to keep the rest of family out of this.
Did you call on us for already know everything?
What do we do now?
We need to give the Barbarians a taste so that they understand we are hard and we has not weakened.
We'll send them a message.
A message that means "war"!
- Do you need anything?
- What do you think?
- Want a drink?
- No.
Okay then...
Bongiorno, sign.
Excuse Roberto.
He is a good man.
I'm John...
Mancino.
Do not forget that.
That's Luigi.
He works with me.
He is a sons spy.
He is good at.
He takes account of things I need to know.
He has been eyeing up some of your new friends.
Cortellos...
He finds out what they think, every they go and who they trust.
These things.
He explains it to me.
I listen and listen and listen.
Sometimes I even...
What is it?
- A discrepancy.
- Yes, that word.
There is a woman hangs all the time with them.
She pops up here and there without some reason.
She is very nice and featured with a different name.
She calls herself Adele.
Who is the woman?
Why does she do that?
How did she get in there?
It is not easy to infiltrate with such types.
Then I got out there for that kind secrets cleans easily.
Her real name is not the which she has presented itself as is Mary.
- Yes, I'm Mary.
- Okay.
Then we found out that Maria experienced something horrible.
Something terrible.
Her husband was murdered.
So why she hangs with them and are so friendly and nice?
She shows up at all their parties...
He, who is very smart says:
"What if it is the who murdered her husband?"
Why would she hang with killers?
Those who have done terrible things.
Why?
- Revenge.
- Is that what you want?
Luigi is very smart.
There he listed out.
Do not worry.
There is no danger.
Luigi wants a flower, but he gets none.
This is for you.
Fuck you, asshole.
Where were you scared, huh?
Vito, why are you here?
Do they trust not in me anymore?
Obviously they trust you.
They thought you had come to provide you.
I've got so much of it there shit that I can provide the entire Palermo.
You call that shit?
For me it's a job.
A new guy from America got here.
His name Mancino.
He's a dangerous guy.
The people of Genoa wants him dead.
He ​​does not respect the rules.
He has formed a gang and has tried to take over a part of Palermo.
A large part of Sicily.
What are you talking about?
Have they come from America to take over Palermo?
Then they have someone who protects them.
Where did you hear that crap?
The information has come directly from New York.
I stood behind the door so I could not fail to hear it.
They have told us to be quiet, but I think it ends badly.
The bastard wants us, family Cortello.
He wants our territory.
Do you understand?
Vito end up stories.
Be quiet.
Be sure to stay away from bullets.
Motherfuckers not kidding.
Listen, Mary.
I'm not one to mince the words.
I'm not rich right now.
I'm not the type that comes with gifts.
Okay?
So here's the deal.
I always expect something in return.
I'll give you what you need for your revenge.
Okay?
Together We will delete Cortellofamiljen from the map.
Are you in?
There is a problem.
You are a woman.
I'm not inclined to let a woman do what I ask of you.
Honestly So are girls pretty emotional.
If you plan to implement it here consider you are no longer that woman.
You can be a mother when you want it.
But when you're having me to no lovers...
Your lover is a weapon.
And you are my weapon.
And I can use it How I want and when I want.
In return, your son and you never miss anything.
I promise.
But I do not want your son to know anything about it.
- Got it?
- Yes.
- In Sicily, it is big news.
- What?
- Mary.
- Which Mary.
Widow of confectioner as Cortellofamiljen murdered.
- Do you get it?
- Yes.
She was approached by Don Mancini, , but now she works for us.
She longs for revenge.
What a woman!
Love and Hate, an explosive mixture.
Apparently, she wants to help us crush the last of Cortellomedlemmarna.
Really?
Good.
Very good.
She will receive a prize.
Come here.
Hello?
Don Antonio, it's Michele.
Hello, how are you?
Bad.
That's why I call you so late.
- What is it?
- An American came here some where late.
He immediately began to make trouble.
I sleep no good anymore.
It was just as I suspected.
Things happen here too.
A Federico, called "cripple", killed Messina and took his territory.
- What to do about it?
- What do you want me to say?
Kill him, otherwise you will get problems.
Is it true that he dealing in drugs and weapons?
Does he have contacts with Islamic terrorists , military and senators?
Yes, everything is true.
You must be on your guard.
I will gather all my men and solve the problem.
- Good.
We heard.
- Keep me posted.
Goodbye.
Michele, I do not see why you asked me to come?
It is very serious, Don Cimino.
It's about the American.
I have been out talking to Franco.
Do not worry.
Believe me, he's a very dangerous guy.
Okay, but he wants to be in charge of drug traffic between Palermo and Trapani
- or prostitution...
What the hell does he want?
He wants to mess around in it all.
Rumor that he wants to destroy us all.
There you catch.
Here it church.
What a pig.
He challenges people.
He ​​hires the unemployed takes care of single mothers.
He ​​attacks only businessmen.
People like you that businessmen are criminals craps.
- What should we do?
- We can beat us together.
We need to show that we exist.
Are we together we can crush him.
I do not agree.
If no do something against my family, I do not.
- It's my decision.
- It is a wrong decision.
For you, not for me.
Now we drink, Miche.
- I know where my place is.
- Really?
Sicily is the land of my dreams.
My dreams.
I had to leave it and I was devastated.
Thank you, Luigi.
Davide...
Welcome.
It was a long time ago.
Good to see you.
I'm sorry, but I think that it a misunderstanding.
I know nothing...
I do not think At all that there is a misunderstanding.
Have I ever aimed at you with a weapon?
I know I have not.
I'm glad to see you.
I have been looking for you for two years.
Now you're here and you look like you feel good and I need help.
Why do you think someone wants to kill you?
I need to sort out some things and I think you can help with that.
That's all I ask.
There are no loose ends.
I'm not mixed up in something.
After the accident, I am away from that.
I have to fix an old problem.
You have nothing with them do anymore, right?
What are you so paranoid for?
Excited, scared, nervous.
What do you think?
I have invited you to my home.
We take a few drinks and converse a little.
I need help.
Not once since we came have you said:
"Hello, John.
Glad to meet you. How have you been?"
It's rude.
Why are you rude?
You'll have to excuse me.
I did not mean to be disrespectful .
But I was worried for my life when they brought me here.
It's true that I killed one of your men.
- Fucking bullshit.
- I do not want to be involved in something.
I have nothing to do with them.
You have not killed anyone.
I know the story.
You and the other sighted with your guns.
And you aimed the other way.
You would shoot him in the head and you did not.
I do not know why you did not do your job , but...
Not pressed by, you did not kill him.
How could I be mad at you?
I am indebted...
I am indebted to you.
No, Danny.
You do not owe me anything.
I'm done with that.
I have only one desire.
I want to return to the monastery where my friend, the priest is.
He is a true friend.
He ​​is my advisor.
Do you think I'm kidding with you?
Do you believe it?
Do you think I'm here to make jokes?
- Say it!
- You are not in debt to me.
You are not in debt!
You are not in debt to me more.
He ​​is not in debt to me.
You heard it too!
It's easy!
Okay...
It's cool.
Get up.
Get up.
You see how easy it was.
It's a simple equation.
We are friends.
You take care of Mary.
As a bodyguard.
I want you to do it.
Make sure she does I told her to do.
Do you trust me?
Do you understand?
Okay?
I got some shit to take care of.
Grazie.
- Who is it?
- Don Antonio.
One of your men, Davide, is a traitor.
He works for the American.
Keep an eye on him.
What's that you say?
How do you know?
You do not know.
Okay, then.
Thank you.
I send Vito, his friend.
He ​​will talk to him.
Is it true he's already dead.
- Okay, we heard.
- Ya.
The bastard.
What the hell has he done?
Three dead and two were our guys.
- And then it disappears bastard.
- It's not his fault.
What the hell are you saying?
People call him "sonar".
- It is said that he works for Mancino.
- Davide is no golare.
I can not ignore the rumors.
He ​​must go away from Palermo.
- Where to?
- As far away as possible.
He must leave Elena, his family and leave.
Vito, what the hell are you talking about?
Are you kidding?
Do you really think I done something like that?
We've known each other since we were little.
We met in school, do not you remember?
Vito...
Have you always been...
You know...
Blind?
It happened before I left Catania.
Two years previously.
We got him here in time for the damage...
- Survives he?
- He has a skull fracture.
He has a small lesion that could cost him his life.
In the beginning it was difficult, when realize that you can not do something.
- You get used to, but...
- Why did you leave Catania?
You do not to my story?
It's true...
But I can see your agonies.
Like while When our pain prevents us from being all that we can be.
Will your husband to pay this pizza, or not?
We accept no blackmail.
Listen.
Do you pay no They'll kill your whole family.
Do you understand?
Go away!
Damn, you could have waited a bit.
I am about to step off.
- Where are we?
- We are heading into Messina.
You are far from Catania.
Either way, I would have loved to tell my story.
But one day, had not sufficed.
I'm glad I met you.
It was really nice.
I have not talked to a priest in a long time.
Somehow Is our past in it.
I wonder if you think you can atone for your sins?
I do not know.
It depends on how you see it.
- What do you mean?
- If there is a difference in. ..
... To commit a sin and that allow a sin is committed.
Then, my dear Leonard, I will never to atone for my sins.
I could not sleep.
- What brings you here?
- Nothing.
- Most curiosity.
- Curious?
Curious to God?
You're a free man now.
You can go back to your life.
You do not want to stay here with a boring priest.
You have your job, your tumvridarjobb... in the hot sun.
You do not stay here.
Go back to that life.
I have no control over my life anymore.
The breathing down my neck all the time.
They blew my mind.
They set me up again.
Men lay traps for men.
God has given us freedom.
His ways are inscrutable at times.
We do not always understand.
But we must keep the faith and to trust in Him.
If it is about life and death?
How can you rely on God for it is about one's own life-
Or someone you love?
You knocked on my door in the middle of the night.
I thought it was urgent.
But there is another reason, right?
Davide...
Are you going to kill me?
Davide?
It's my fault, Carlo.
They blamed me for say too much to you.
I needed to talk to someone.
And I said too much.
How long are you wearing?
I do not know.
Are you here because you to do it yourself?
Why are you here, Davide?
Why?
They want me to do it for to show my loyalty.
They know how much I care about you.
I must show that I are ready to obey.
What you said in the confession stays with the priest.
Had it not been you would be somebody else, right?
Do not you, they kill you.
I understand, son.
You have the future ahead of you.
I have already done it I will.
You have made a decision and you have to...
You have to do what you're doing.
You're a good man, Davide.
You are a good man.
You'll surely God's forgiveness.
I give you mine anyway.
You know I can not do it.
You're my brother.
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit name...
Dear God, was in this man and give him strength and courage.
And your will be done, not ours forever.
Here...
Take this.
My Brother.
No!
God, no!
Why?
Why?
Davide...
Do not lose your heart.
Salvation is Is possible for everyone.
But I feel you're ready.
I speak from personal experience.
Miracle are possible.
Catania is ready to forgive you.
I know that woman you love also is ready to forgive you.
Whoever she is.
Oh, my God.
I do not know longer my arms.
- Oh, my God.
- Do not get upset.
- What happened?
Where am I?
- On a son's clinic.
You are a victim of an accident.
I'm Dr. Messa.
An accident...?
I do not remember I have been involved in an accident.
You can not make.
You hit the head when you fell down the stairs.
The voice sounds like...
Signore?
We're here now.
You should go by.
- Need help?
- No.

JACK:
Earth, before the war.
New York, before I was born.
A place I've only seen pictures of.
I know you... But we've never met.
I'm with you...
But I don't know your name.
I know I'm dreaming.
But it feels like more than that.
March 14th, 2077.
Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.
And I'm still haunted by these dreams.
Victoria and I were assigned together.
In two weeks, our mission here will be finished, and we'll join the others.
But the questions I ask, she doesn't.
The things I wonder about, she won't.
It's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.
Forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.
Without the moon, the Earth was thrown into chaos.
Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.
Tsunamis wiped out what remained.
Then came the invasion.
We did what we had to do.
We used the nukes.
We won the war, but lost the planet.
Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.
What remained of humanity had to leave the Earth.
We built the Tet, our mission control.
A temporary space station before the migration to Titan,
Saturn's largest moon.
Everyone's there now.
Well, almost everyone.
Until our tour is complete, Vika and I do our job.
We protect the hydro rigs, which convert Earth's sea water into fusion energy for the new colony.
The survival of humanity depends on it.
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you for the coffee.
Remnants of the scavenger army continue to disrupt the operation. They attack our drones at night, and try to kill me during the day. There's still fight in them, but I don't know why.
Mission says we have done well.
That we are an effective team.
Vika's my communications officer.
She keeps an eye on me.
I handle drone maintenance.
The drones watch everything.
Vika can't wait to go.
Me, I'm not so sure.
I can't shake the feeling that Earth, in spite of all that's happened...
Earth is still my home.
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
Morning, Bob.
JACK: (THROUGH SPEAKERS) Tower, comm check.
Drone Maintenance Technician 49, hydro rig support.
All Bubbleship systems are green.
I'm good to go.
Copy, Tech-49, you're cleared.
Be careful out there.
Always am.
No, you're not.
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta work on that.
All right, Tet's coming online in 30 seconds.
Relaying hydro rig coordinates now.
Confirm visual.
I got 'em.
Hydro rigs are sucking seawater.
You got 'em, Bob?
Drone 185 looks good.
Jack, we've got two drones down.
Shit.
Stand by, Mission coming online.
VICTORIA:
And we have Tet contact.
Morning, boss.
Tower 49, this is Mission Control.
How y'all doing this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise, Sally.
Uploading data now.
49 mission log.
Day 1642, hydro rig support.
I have two...
You have two drones offline.
Perimeter's compromised.
Copy that, relaying to Tech.
Stand by.
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.
Linking to beacon now.
You'll go there first.
Got it.
On my way.
VICTORIA: Mission, Tech-49 is en route to Grid 37 now.
Can you plug that hole with Drone 109?
Negative, 109 is in the dock. Still waiting for parts.
Jack better find those drones and get 'em flying.
Those rigs can't be exposed overnight.
Copy that.
(GRUNTS)
SALLY'.
Tower, didn't he fix 166 recently?
Jack has fixed all the drones recently.
And, if we had the parts that we've been asking for, we wouldn't be running a skeleton crew down here.
Understood.
We're doing the best we can.
Are you an effective team?
We are an effective team.
Your directive today is to rehabilitate 166 and find 172.
Get 'em flying by sundown, and I'll buy you two a round of drinks when you get up to the Tet.
You had better be ready, Sally.
Two weeks now, we're keeping track.
(GRUNTS)
Okay.
Come on, Bob.
Work with me, here, buddy.
Tech-49?
Tech-49?
Jack?
Copy, Tower.
What happened?
I lost you for a second.
Really?
JACK". Coming up on location.
There it is.
I've got multiple scav kills.
Drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.
Got any movement?
No sign of scavenger activity.
But I've got limited visibility, here, Jack, due to low angle of Mission.
Copy that. I'm coming in hot.
Starting repairs. Watch my back.
I always do.
You know, I read about this game.
It was played right here.
The last Super Bowl.
Down by four.
The ball was on the 50-yard line.
Seconds left on the clock.
The ball is snapped, and the QB fumbles.
Disaster.
Looks like the game is over.
I'm reading the whole central core off-alignment.
You don't have the necessary tools down there.
And a new fuel cell is not going to fix that.
But this QB runs back, and picks up his own fumble.
Hold on, what did you just do?
There's a wall of linebackers closing in on him.
So, he throws a long ball with no idea who is at the other end.
A Hail Mary.
Eighty-thousand people on their feet, watching this ball sail through the air.
Downfield is a rookie wide receiver, third string.
He just leaps out of the pack.
Touchdown!
(IMITATES CHEERING)
Contact!
West contact!
VICTORIA:
Jack?
It's okay, Vika.
It's just a dog.
Hey.
Now, go on.
You gotta get out of here.
Go on, get!
Get out of here!
Go!
Tech-49, Jack Harper.
You're welcome.
(SCOFFS)
166 is back online.
Two drones shot down today.
Ten fuel cells stolen in just over a month.
These scavs are getting bolder.
VICTORIA:
Well, the hydro rigs are taking all the water.
Once we're gone, they'll have nothing but dust and radiation.
JACK'.
This is bullshit.
We won the war.
Now we have to leave.
Two more weeks, Jack.
Then we'll be on our way to Titan.
Yep.
That drone is out there somewhere.
We just have to find it.
Without a beacon, that's like finding a needle in a haystack.
(CHUCKLES)
So we go to our ground game.
Tower, I've located 172 down a sinkhole.
No visual, but I can hear it.
Tet's so far off angle, I can barely see you.
How's it look?
It's good, it's good.
There's no sign of scav activity on top.
Tet's offline in 15 minutes.
After that, you're on your own.
VICTORIA:
Mission, this is Tower 49.
Jack has located drone 172.
Engaged in recovery now.
Requesting backup to his location ASAP.
I've got a visual on Drone 172.
Jack?
(CLATTERS)
What the hell?
Shit.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
Ha!
Jack!
Tech-49, Jack Harper.
Jack Harper, Tech-49!
Hey!
Oh, no.
Come on.
Not my goddamn bike!
JACK: (READING) "How can a man die better Than facing fearful odds
"For the ashes of his fathers And the temples of his Gods"
VICTORIA:
Jack?
Yep, I'll be right there.
VICTORIA:
How does 109 look?
Can it fly?
Barely.
And without armor, she's a sitting duck.
Well, I'll talk to Sally about that shielding in the morning.
Okay.
Again.
(CHUCKLES)
What, Jack Harper?
Where did you get this?
It was growing in... (DOOR OPENING)
Come on, Jack, you know the regulations.
I know you think I'm a stickler but you have no idea what kind of toxins could be in something like that.
It's a flower, Vika.
Yeah, that's not the point.
It's that we are so close to the end, and the last thing that we need is you putting it all at risk.
Okay.
Every day, you have to go down there and see what was lost.
But we've done our job, Jack.
It's time to go.
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.
The scavs.
They were trying to catch me.
Well, they can't have you.
Come on.
You should come with me sometime, before we leave.
There's a place I found I'd like to show you.
(WHISPERS) I'll show you something.
Hey,hev!
(PANTS)
(RUMBLING)
Oh, my God.
VICTORIA:
It was a six-stage meltdown from inside the hydro rig's core.
It's offline permanently.
SALLY:
Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.
Jack believes the scavs weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells and got it into the suction.
VICTORIA:
SALLY 1 Tower, hold.
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37.
Are you seeing this?
Yes.
JACK:
It's gotta be scav.
It's not one of ours.
Jack, the signal is being directed off-planet.
On my Way-
Tower, our logs show you are missing an additional nine fuel cells.
Can you confirm?
Negative, Mission, that number is 10.
Drone 172 was lost last night.
109 is combat-ready as soon as we get that shielding.
We can cover the remaining rigs with drones in the field.
I've run the numbers.
We'll do the numbers up here, Tower.
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.
COPY-
Our job is to run those rigs.
Your directive is to protect them.
We cannot afford to lose another.
Do you copy?
COPY-
Are you and Jack an effective team?
Damn right we are.
Jack?
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?
Jack?
Yeah, I got it.
They have some kind of a repeater.
The scavs are using the building as an antenna.
Can you decrypt?
It's a set of coordinates.
Grid 17.
It's a goddamn homing beacon.
Grid 17.
What the hell is out there?
Nothing.
It's the middle of nowhere.
What is going on?
Why would the scavs send a signal off-planet, Jack?
I'm shutting it down.
Tech-49, check your course.
You're headed right for the border.
That radiation will cook you from the inside before you know it.
It's okay, Vika.
I see it.
I'm gonna do a perimeter check before I head home.
I may go off-comm.
Jack, we should keep in contact.
Just let me know where you are.
Do you COPY?
Jack, do you copy?
That's right, Bob.
You know where we're going.
(CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
Are you gonna miss me?
(CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna miss this place.
It would have been great.
It would have been great.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
(GASPS)
(RUMBLING)
JACK:
Vika?
Vika, did you get that?
VICTORIA:
Jack, where have you been?
An object came down in 17.
That's the beacon coordinates.
Exactly.
I saw it.
Some sort of vessel.
Jack, Mission's almost offline.
I'm en route now.
Mission, we have an unidentified object impact in 17.
It came down at coordinates sent by a scav beacon.
My tech's en route now.
Tower, we're going offline soon, but drones are already mobile and executing.
Have your tech stand down.
COPY-
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.
JACK:
That's a negative, Tower.
With Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.
I want to know this site is secure.
Sally, my tech's concerned about the security of the site.
Tower, you have lost enough assets for today.
Keep your tech out of there.
Do you copy?
Copy, Command, I'm...
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this.
JACK'.
I'm on site.
Jack.
I don't have eyes on you.
Command's offline.
Vika, I think it's one of ours.
This thing is ancient.
It looks pre-war.
The scavs brought this thing down, Jack.
There's no sign of scavs.
Technician, this is your Control.
I'm ordering you to pull out and return to the tower immediately.
Touching down.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERING) They're human.
Tower, we have got survivors.
There are four...
Check it, five survivors.
They are human.
(GASPS)
Stand down!
Vika, the drones are firing on survivors.
Jack, the Tet's offline.
(STAMMERING) I don't have control.
Stand down!
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
Back off, you son of a bitch!
Back off!
Open the door.
Vika!
Get the med kit.
Get the med kit!
This has to be reported.
Be sure and report that the drones killed the crew from one of our own ships.
See what Command makes of that.
(GASPS)
(SPUTTERS)
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.
Jack.
Here.
You're still dehydrated.
Where are we?
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.
VICTORIA:
What's your name?
I'm Julia.
VICTORIA:
Julia...
I'm sorry for what I have to tell you, but you were in a crash.
Your ship came down.
Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.
But none of your crew survived.
What do you mean?
You're the only one that made it.
I'm sorry.
You've been in delta sleep for a long time.
Some disorientation is normal.
How long?
Sixty years.
At least.
I have to get back to our ship.
It's too dangerous down there.
You need to rest.
Vika...
Don't touch me.
Your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon from the surface.
Do you know anything about that?
What was your mission?
It's classified.
Well, we have no record of an Odyssey...
I can't tell you anything until I get the flight recorder from my ship.
Julia,a lot has changed in 60 years.
While you were in delta sleep,
Earth was attacked.
Call them scavs.
They destroyed our moon and with that, half the planet.
Then they invaded.
We won the war, but Earth was ruined.
Everyone's on Titan now.
It's a moon of Saturn.
Or on the space station, getting ready to go.
We're here for security and drone maintenance.
We're the mop-up crew.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
You've lost people.
Everything.
If you want to be alone, we understand.
The drones killed her entire crew.
If I hadn't gotten there...
I want her gone first thing.
Vika...
Do you have any memories before the mission?
Before the security wipe?
Our job is not to remember.
Remember?
Do you remember her?
Jackâ€œ.
That was a scav beacon that brought her down.
We don't know who she is.
Or what she is.
Let's just get through the night.
Okay?
You fly that thing?
Yes.
What happens now?
The Tet will be online soon.
Victoria will report your rescue.
They'll send someone down for you.
From the Tet?
Yes.
I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.
The scavs, they move at night.
They could be all over it by now.
I need to know what happened.
You need to know what happened.
Please.
Jack?
Jack, what are you doing?
Vika, she's a flight officer.
She wants to see her ship and secure the flight recorder.
Now, you would want the same thing.
Jack,Lâ€œ...
I can't protect you.
No, I understand.
This one's on me.
I couldn't save them.
(ALARM BLARING)
Jack.Jack!
Jack, can you hear me?
(PANTING)
All right, it's time to go.
Jack.
I found it.
(SCREAMS)
Jack!
(JULIA SCREAMING)
(ENGINES WHIR)
(MISSION CHIMES ONLINE)
Tower 49, how are y'all this lovely morning?
Another day in paradise.
Sally...
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol and went off-comm
near the canyons in 17.
Now, I know we're low on drones, but, um, requesting one to sweep the area.
Just a quick scout.
Copy 49, tasking 185 to Grid 22.
BEECH: "And how can a man die better Than facing fearful odds
"For the ashes of his fathers
"And the temples of his Gods"
I've been watching you, Jack.
You're curious.
What are you looking for in those books?
Do they bring back old memories?
You won't get anything from me.
My memory has been wiped to protect the security of the mission.
Yes.
You can't have your precious memory falling into the wrong hands, now, can you?
Tell me.
Have you ever met a scav up close?
Of course not.
You just repair drones.
"Don't go into the radiation zone."
"Don't ask too many questions."
Not part of the job description.
Lights.
We're not alien, Jack.
We're human.
Of course, for us, being human is a problem.
Old stealth fighter tech.
Shields us from your scanners.
Vocal scrambling.
(IN SCRAMBLED VOICE) Can you hear me, Jack?
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Keeps your drones confused.
Well, most of the time.
The drones are programmed...
To kill humans, Jack.
You saw what they did to those sleep pods.
You almost got yourself blown to bits protecting that woman.
Why did you do that?
Anyone would have.
"Anyone."
Interesting.
SYKES:
We're wasting our time.
The drone will track him here.
BEECH:
That's Sergeant Sykes.
He thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.
I hope you prove him wrong.
(BEEP S)
Mission, I'm picking up a bio trail somewhere near the west canyons.
Can you confirm the sequence?
Stand by.
DNA confirmed.
It's Jack.
(CHUCKLES)
Vika, are you okay?
Everything good between you two?
Of course.
You're still an effective team?
We're great.
Never better.
BEECH:
We were running a ground game, and losing.
So, we decided, "What the hell?
"We've got to throw the long ball."
It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.
That's how you brought down the Odyssey.
Why?
BEECH:
The Odyssey's compact reactor, courtesy of NASA.
Very hard to come by.
Did you like the show last night?
That was just one fuel cell.
Imagine what 10 of them will do, with a core of weapons-grade plutonium.
We have a nuke, and we have a drone to carry it.
But we can't access it.
It doesn't know who we are.
But it knows you, Jack.
We need you to program the drone.
Have it carry our nuke up to the Tet.
End this war.
There are people up there.
Sergeant.
Program the drone to return to the Tet.
It needs to go right to the center.
Screw you.
We haven't got time for this.
(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
Hey.Hey!
No.
(ALARM BLARING)
SYKES:
Let's go!
Get him up.
Mission, 185 just went off-grid.
Copy, Tower, we're seeing the same thing.
Permission to task two additional drones?
If one drone is here, more will come.
And they won't stop until they find me.
They'll turn this place to dust.
But if you let us go, I'll call them off.
It's your only chance.
I've been to your
"radiation zones."
If you're looking for the truth, that's where you'll find it.
You've risked all our lives. Everything.
What makes you think he's different?
She does.
(BEEPING)
(BEEPING)
VICTORIA:
Mission, I've found my tech over in 37.
You can call off the search.
SALLY:
Copy that, Tower.
Glad Jack's safe.
Tasking the other drones back to rig support.
Where are we going now?
Who are you?
What aren't you telling me?
Jack,Lâ€œ
What were you doing on the Odyssey?
What was your mission?
It was a research flight to Titan.
My first.
That's what it was supposed to be.
Six weeks to launch, deep space scanners picked up an alien object.
We were reassigned to investigate.
They put us all in delta.
They must have woken you and Victoria first.
What?
That object was the Tet, Jack.
The Tet was our mission.
That's impossible.
That's impossible!
Who are you?
I'm your wife.
I don't know what happened, but you're not who you think you are.
Jack, we were here.
You asked me to meet you, brought me up on top of the world.
I could tell you were nervous that day.
It was right here, Jack.
You said,
"Look through here,
"and I'll show you the future." (WHISPERING)
And I held up a ring.
And you said...
"Yes."
There you are.
There you are.
(MOUTHING) Hi.
Hello.
Come on.
(INAUDIBLE)
JACK'.
Vika, I'm coming in.
Do not report to Mission until I get back.
Do you copy?
Do you COPY?
Vika, open the door.
Stay away from me.
I don't want to hear it.
It's not safe here, and we need to leave, now.
It was always her.
Wasn't it?
Vika...
She's my wife.
Mission, this is Tower 49.
SALLY:
Go ahead, 49.
No.
I'm having a problem with my technician.
No, you don't know what you're doing.
He found a survivor at the crash site.
You've gotta listen to me.
She's impeding his abilities, and he is unfit for service.
No,no,no.
SALLY'.
I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.
Are you still an effective team?
Vika...
Open the goddamn door, Vika!
No.
We are not an effective team.
(DOOR CHIMES)
Vika, please.
We have to go now.
I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack.
There's a place I know.
We'll be safe.
I'm going to Titan.
There is no Titan.
They lied to us.
(CRYING) Just stay away from me.
Vika, please, there are things...
Things you need to know.
I don't want to know!
Jackâ€œ.
(VICTORIA SCREAMS)
(GRUNTS)
Hi, Jack.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
What have you done?
You can't blame yourself for this.
Drones are unreliable.
Sometimes things go wrong.
"Go wrong" ?
You killed her.
I know, it's tragic.
She was a wonderful person.
Jack, we want to bring you in.
I've been authorized to tell you we're going to assign you a new mission.
You and the survivor.
There's a lot of interest up here.
Bring her up.
We can debrief, then anything's possible.
It's time to come home, Jack.
Jack?
Jack?
Jackâ€œ.
I'm sorry.
Hang on.
Lightning.
That's the plan.
We need cover.
There.

Are you okay?
No.

Don't worry, we're staying out of there.
(ALARM BLARING)
Are we gonna die?
No!
Maybe.

Hey!
Wait!

Hey.
There you are.
What happened?
Are you okay?
That bogey came across the border and then I lost you.
False alarm.
(SIGHS)
I should get back out there.
You come all the way home, and I don't get a kiss?
(CHUCKLES)
What's going on up there?
I was thinking...
Why don't you come down with me?
To the surface?
We could go right now.
(LAUGHING) Now?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
You won't believe what's down there.
Jackâ€œ.
You know the regulations.
Yes.
Can we not do this again?
I'm done talking about it.
Okay.
This is gonna hurt.

(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON TURNTABLE)
You always loved this song.
I'm not him.
I know I'm not.
But I've loved you for as long as I can remember.
I don't know how else to say it.
You know what you said to me once?
You said when it was all over, you would build me a house on a lake.
We would grow old and fat together.
And we would fight.
Maybe drink too much.
Real romantic.
And then we would die and be buried in a meadow by the lake.
And the world would forget about us.
But we would always have each other.
I remember.
Those memories are yours, Jack.
They're ours.
They are you.
(SLOW MUSIC CONTINUES)
Good morning.
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.
You still can.
I have to go.
Those people need my help.
We'll come back when it's over.
Promise me.
We'll come back when it's over.
(GUN COCKS)
You had me worried for a second.
I thought you weren't coming back.
Well, I had to prove him wrong.
You look like shit.
You should see the other guy.

I still do.

Come on.
(MISSION CHIMES ONLINE)
Mission, I'm picking up a bio-trail somewhere near the West Canyons.
Can you confirm the sequence?
SALLY". Stand by.
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.
Mission, 185 just went off-grid.
Copy, Tower.
We're seeing the same thing.
I'd been in the army less than a year when that unholy Tet arrived.
I saw the moon get taken out.
Right up there in the night sky.
I couldn't believe it.
After that, nature took over.
There's bedrock around Chicago, so we were spared the worst of the waves and the quakes.
Most people just starved.
Then the Tet sent troop ships down.
The doors opened, and out you came.
Astronaut Jack Harper.
Thousands of you.
Memory wiped.
Programmed to kill.
They had taken one of our best and turned him against us.
No soul.
No humanity.
The Tet.
What a brilliant machine.
Feeding off one planet after another for energy.
Phase Two was drones.
Repairmen.
50 years of watching those hydro rigs suck our planet dry.
Then one day,
I saw you set down.
Another drone to fix.
But in the rubble that day was a book.
You picked it up.
You studied it.
And I thought I saw a way.
When you stepped in front of that drone and saved her,
I knew.
You were in there somewhere.
I just had to find a way to bring you back.
(DRONE WAILS)
Watch it, watch it.
Eyes on it.
Steady.
Give it some space.
Come on, you're making it nervous.
That is one pissed-off weapon.
No, it's just a machine.
I'm the weapon.
I would love to be there to see that thing's face when this goes off.
That would be a one-way trip.
Yeah, but it would be worth it.
Welcome back, Commander.

You know it will swat you like a fly.
Not if I go.
No.

So bring me up.
We'll go together.

MALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Flight recorder playback for the Odyssey mission.
3 May, 2017.
Okay, Bob.
Ready for space?
(CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
SALLY'.
Good morning, Odyssey, from your friends here at Mission Control.
JACK". Good morning, Mission. This is Commander Jack Harper.
Thank you for that fantastic wake-up call.
Pre-rendezvous checks complete.
Electrical guidance and nav systems, all good.
Range behind object, 250 clicks... 12 below V-bar, closure rate 200 kilometers per hour.
Copy that.
It's good to see you, Jack.
After 39 days of sleep, sounds like you're ready to go.
I'm ready to go.
Your next burn will bring you up level and co-speed at 50 kilometer range, where you'll hold.
We'll hold 50 clicks from object for sensor scan and evaluation.
Targets look good.
Initiating burn in 3,2,1...
Ignition.
We see a good burn.
Are you reading any output from the object?
Negative.
Zero heat.
No EMR.
There's no sign of life.
How is the rest of the crew doing?
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen should be up here shortly.
The rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.
Copy that.
You missed a hell of a game last night.
What did I tell you guys?
No spoilers about last night's game.
I'm looking forward to watching it when I get back.
You're not talking about football already, are you?
SALLY". Good morning, Vika.

Good morning, Sally.
How are you doing this lovely morning?

Hey.
One for history.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

Hello, Sally.
It's a busy morning, huh?
I'm picking up a second passenger, Jack.
It's Julia Rusakova, the female survivor from the crashed module.
State your intention.
Deliver the survivor, as requested.
We are a more effective team.
Proceed to entry.
JACK'.
Mission, we have a situation.
The last burn was spot-on to give us a SO-click hold from object, but radar range still decreasing.
We're accelerating toward the object.
We're going to need full OMS burn to pull away.
Initiate now.
Entering target.
Gimbals set.
Target's good.
Arm forward engines.

Ready?
Let's go.

There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.

Welcome home, Jack.

Jack, you're doing the right thing.
I don't know what you are, or where you're from, but I'd like to tell you about something I read.
A story from Rome, a city you destroyed.
It's a classic.
There was a guy, Horatius, held the bridge alone against a whole army.
And what Horatius said was,
"How can a man die better..."
You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.
Everybody dies, Sally.
The thing is, to die well.
Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.
No, it's not.
What Horatius said was,
"How can a man die better
JACK:
"Than facing fearful odds"
Drones! Get inside! Get inside!
JACK:
"For the ashes of his fathers
"And the temples of his Gods"
SALLY:
I created you, Jack.
I am your God.
Fuck you, Sally.
JACK:
Earth, after the war.
Three years have passed since I saw your face.
I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.
In the day, as memories.
Do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?
And I wonder if you see me when you look at her.
Mommy, look.
If we have souls, they are made of the love we share.
Undimmed by time.
Unbound by death.
For three years, I searched for the house he built.
I knew it had to be out there.
Because I know him.

I am Jack Harper.

Why did Niles leave all his cash to Ellen, to you?
He didn't have any kids of his own.

I'm so sorry about my overzealous brother.

- Yeah.
- I had no idea.
Robert Brogden, sr., our daddy, was sheriff for two decades before him.

He's just a little bit unsettled because there's been a rash of crime lately.
And, uh, Tremo's a small town.

Anyway-- there's been a little hiccup in your case.

Mm-hmm.
Somebody has filed an injunction.
An--an injunction?
Who?
I don't know.
Some guy's claiming he's Niles' son.
I don't get it.
Doesn't the will leave everything to me?
Yes, it does.
However, if Niles didn't know he had a son and then suddenly he found out about this son and if this son could somehow prove that Niles was in the middle of...
Changing his will to include his son, well, that wouldn't be good. However, if we could prove that while Niles knew he had this son, he still wasn't gonna leave him nothin'...
That would be better.

Sure.
Thanks.
What's this?
I found this a few days ago.
[ CHUCKLES ]
This is very telling.
I'm glad you showed this to me.
This will definitely help your case.
But you still gonna need something more.
More?
This isn't his letter.
What you need is something written by him, that says all of his estate goes to Ellen, despite any other claims.
What, uh...
What are the odds of finding that?
You know what?
There's no reason to get...
Too concerned.
When I think about it, the burden of proof is gonna be on this rival party.
It's just, uh...
It's just gonna take a little more time, and round here, we ain't got nothin' but time.

- In your professional opinion...
- Mm-hmm.

Well--hmm.

You need a document stating that Niles wanted his money going to his niece and his niece only.
I don't have that document.
Well, you got a problem then, don't you?
Yeah, I'll bet Niles knew all about this, 'cause he came to me two days before he passed away.
He was gonna have me change his will to explicitly exclude anyone but Ellen.

Bob, leave it be.
You know, I was looking for you today.
For me?
Well, if it was about the housekeeping, that could've waited till tomorrow.
No, it wasn't about the housekeeping.
You and your late husband, you, uh-- you raised two sons, sheriff Bob and Cameron.
Yes, that's right.
Two big, beautiful boys.
Your family didn't mind all those long hours with you keeping house for Zachary Niles?
Well, they-- it was a privilege to work for someone as accomplished and-- and prosperous as Mr. Niles.
And we needed the extra money.
Heh.
You, the late sheriff, Bob...
You're like three peas in a pod.
[ LAUGHS ] Yes.
Not Cameron, though.
Well, I don't know what you mean.
You truly admired and respected Niles, right?
Yes, of course.
I told you.
That-- you had a son with him, didn't you?
What?
How dare you?
I read the letters you wrote him, the ones asking him to acknowledge your son.
How could you stand for it?
After the way you took care of him?
After the way you felt about him?
It wasn't that simple.
What would people think if they knew what we were up to?
How would they treat my family, my husband, my two little boys?
Cameron is Niles' son.
And when Niles handed the inheritance to Ellen,
Cameron realized that he was gonna be cut out of everything that was rightfully his, out out...
Just like his mother had been.
You have no right-- deep down, you have to know...
That it was Cameron that killed Niles.
That is not possible.
Zach--
Mr. Niles' death was an accident.
No, no.
No, you're not up on current affairs, ma'am.
The coroner's office ruled Niles' death a homicide.
Your son killed his own father.

I saw you at the motel tonight.
Yep.
Tell me something, Sarah.
Uh...
Did you fuck him first and then kill him?
How exactly did that go down?
That guy is Ellen's dealer.
She owed him a ton of money, and for some reason, he thinks I'm the one who has to pay him back.
Well, he's dead now.
Might as well get rid of me next, right?
I assume that is the plan, after all.
Why share the money with Edward or me?
I didn't even know about Ellen's money until I found that letter!
So you-- besides, this is your fucking scheme!
Do you remember that?
You're telling me that Edward carney didn't have the exact same plan a whole lot earlier?
You're drunk.

There's no bedtime curfew, so they're going to be up all night.
Make sure you bring your earplugs.
Boom!
- C'mon, best two out of three.
- No.
Best two out of three.
That didn't count.
You didn't tell me about the karaoke machine.
(WHISTLING TUNE)
Zandar.
Mr President.
Aren't you supposed to stop people from shooting my dad?
Baldy.
Idiot.
Enough out of you, Lee Harvey.
Go clean up the chocolate stains you left in your mother's bedroom.
(MEOWING)
Kitty likes to scratch.
(SIGHS) Next time, take out his fat ass.
It would be my pleasure, sir.
I brought you some news.
The G.I. Joes are about to be out of the picture.
And by "out of the picture," I mean alive on earth.
Got a little too close to Mount Olympus.
Huh?
(WHISPERS) Had to strike them down.
They'll find you out, Zartan.
No. No, I don't think so.
That's the beauty of nanomites.
Here, take a look.
Hmm?
Flawless microtechnology.
You're insane.
Recess over.
Sit him down.
You know, they say this is a thankless job.
But yesterday I hung out with Bono.
My new Secret Service, they want to burn the Constitution.
Literally.
And my interns...
Oh, yeah, I brought back the interns.
Mmm-mmm.
Do you know my favourite bit?
I get to blow stuff up.
Oh, I bet that endears you to the people.
Well, that's the thing.
Your approval ratings climbed nine points.
Apparently, America wants someone who looks like you, but acts like me.
I'm the quicker blower-upper, baby.
Only one drawback.
The little wifey-pooh?
(GASPS) Huh?
If you touch my family... (LAUGHS) I'm yanking your chain.
Two long terms of you, just a few short months of me.
So let's not waste the time I got left.
Where is the prison that holds Cobra Commander and Destro?
Is this where I ask you, what do you have planned?
Why does anyone want to be President?
Everybody wants to rule the world.

Today, the world's elite fighting force, the G.I. Joes, abandoned their duty
and broke the sacred bond that exists between the American people and those entrusted with their security.
(GRUNTING)

Ready and step.
(GRUNTING)
Ready and step!
The first domino fell with the murder of the Pakistani president.
The assassin, a Joe,
call sign
Snake Eyes.
But he didn't act alone.
The Joes intended to use this situation to seize Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.
Now this incident serves as a sobering reminder of the scourge of nuclear weapons.
And to that end,
I call upon my fellow world leaders to convene immediately to discuss nuclear disarmament.
On three.
One.
(FLINT GROANS)
Two.
Three!
(ALL GRUNTING)
ZARTAN:
The G.I. Joes clearly went beyond the boundaries of their mission.
On my orders a covert Special Forces unit code named Cobra terminated with extreme prejudice Joe Command, facilities, personnel.

The G.I. Joes are no more.
(GRUNTS)
We should leave.
There's nothing here.
There's nothing left here?
- That's not what he meant!
- These are our brothers!
That's not what he meant!
Whoever did this is going to come back.
We need to move.
You are our leader now.
We head due east until we're clear.
We're gonna find the man who did this to Duke and our brothers.
And we're gonna kill him.

Last place I thought I'd see you.
Warden James.
It's a pleasure.
I'm a very big fan.
I love the black.
It's very Johnny Cash.
Come.
Welcome to Einsargen.
Let me tell you a little bit about the place.
Listen to me.
I sound like a real-estate agent.
I'm not here to sell you anything.
Except maybe hopelessness. (LAUGHS)
(SIGHS)
How was your trip?
The sensation that you're feeling, your upside-down tummy?
It's due to our descent into a former East German mine shaft.
It was the deepest they ever dug.
So deep in fact that you just crossed out of Germany into international territory.
Which allows me certain jurisdictional freedoms.
Huh?
One word, awesome.
This room is awesome!
Temperatures here exceed 210 degrees when not artificially cooled to a crisp 68.
Almost calls for a Snuggie.
Wait till you see this next one.
(SIGHS LOUDLY)
See what I mean?
This just slays me.
It's so interesting.
This is where science has come.
Did you know that during REM sleep, the human body
produces a neural chemical which paralyses every muscle in the body but the heart and the eyes?
This prevents us from acting out our dreams.
We have injected both of these men with a synthetic version.
They're perfectly awake.
They're conscious, they're aware of everything that's going on around them.
It's just that they're trapped inside themselves.
Well, I believe you know your new neighbours, Destro,
Cobra Commander.
Oh, the three of you are like my fantasy football team.
Gentlemen.
Now as your eyes and mind travel to where you cannot, I want you to agonise.
I want you to pine.
I want you to ache for what once was and will never be again.
I want you to doubt that there was ever a word for escape.
Welcome to hell.
SNAKE:
You have no idea.
Snake Eyes speaks.
It never occurred to me what you might sound like.
But I've always thought about what you might look like.
We'll have that mask.
Storm Shadow.
(CHUCKLES)
So you killed the Pakistani president.
Well, you're not exactly my first-round draft pick, but I've always been a fan.
FLINT:
Protocol says we make a distress call, right?
ROADBLOCK:
No. Protocol died with the unit.
FLINT:
What?
How's anybody gonna know we're alive?
They're not, 'cause we're not.
To our government, to our families, but especially to our enemy, we were KIA at 0600 hours in the Indus Valley Desert.
But we have to at least try.
I mean, there might be...
No. Anything we do now is a rumour of a rumour.
Any and all traces of our existence is terminated.
The only one I trust out there is Snake Eyes.
When we got hit, how we got hit, we were set up right from the start.
How many stars would someone need on their shoulder to call an attack like that?
Four?
Five?
No, not stars.
Buttons on his suit.
National Security Advisor.
Secretary of Defence.
No. There's only one man who could authorise a strike like that.
And I voted for him.

Can I trust you with nothing?
They'll slip up.
And when they do,
I'll hunt 'em to ground.
COBRA COMMANDER:
Hoo-ah.
No, no, it's cool.
I got it.
You lost, little man?
No, I ain't lost.
I think you got the wrong street.
So why don't you take Miley Cyrus and Ryan Seacrest and head back that way?
I'm going that way.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go ahead, Marvin.
Man, don't call me that name.
(BOTH LAUGH)
- What's up?
Little Marvin!
- Marvin?
STOOP:
- Big Marvin now.
Had you worried for a minute, man.
Watch your hand back there, boy.
You don't want them to get you.
Look at you.
You got grown.
How your parents make a kid this big, man?
- His parents are like 5'2" apiece.
- Really?
STOOP:
You're taking that P9OX serious, huh?
(LAUGHS) Twice a week.
I see. Look at the size of your neck.
Let me introduce you. This is Flint.

Lady Jaye.
Lady Jaye. Hey.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
It's what happens when you're in trouble, you come home.
Home is where the help is.
Amen.
Well, we got you.
Set up at the rec centre.
Lay low over there.
Nobody gonna bother you.
As far as wheels go,
I'm gonna let you roll my truck.
Thank you.
I got payments on that truck, man.
I don't get it like I used to.
All right?
(CHUCKLES) Thank you, Stoop.
I owe you one, brother.
Actually, you owe me two.
- That other one don't count.
Welcome home, Marvin.

Watch your step.
No one's been here for years.
This is gonna have to be our pit for now.
(JAYE WHISTLES)
Wow.
It's an actual pit.
It's my old stomping ground.
FLINT:
Are you sure we can trust this Stoop guy?
- Stoop's no angel.
(COUGHS)
But he is family and we can trust him.
Can we be traced?
We can mask our IP addresses.
I'll cyber-blast an encoded beacon every six hours.
If any Joes did survive, we need to let them know where we're at.
All right.
Well, let's get to work.
Flint, inventory every piece of equipment we got left.
Jaye, start that database on our President.
We'll find out what's going on with our Commander-in-Chief.
He's not acting like the man we know.
We find out why, we can start being soldiers again.

If any Joes have survived...
This channel's restricted to Joes, isn't it?
...magnetic west of the Potomac.
They're alive.
This is Lieutenant Lady Jaye requesting immediate aid.
JINX:
Lieutenant Lady Jaye, this is Jinx and Snake Eyes.
We are in pursuit of Storm Shadow.
Even if Snake Eyes and Jinx grab Storm, they're still halfway around the world.
We're on our own.
Enough for a battle.
Not a war.
We're fighting uphill here.
I came here when I was 14 with a life expectancy of 13.
I was bounced around from home to home, until this became my home.
Guys were lined up outside that door to fight me.
They whooped my skinny ass so much I started to enjoy it.
Till one winter,
I grew 8 inches and gained 60 pounds.
I punched a guy so hard he couldn't move his arm to tap out.
Then when the Joes came recruiting to the hood,
I'd already beaten down half of it.
I became a Joe to serve.
In the field.
So if we're fighting uphill, we take the hill.
JAYE:
Hey, I got something you'll want to see.
During my check of the President, look what I found.
This is the President on August 9th.
PRESIDENT: ...an addiction to offshore energy, where we 're forced to be kind of embroiled in the affairs of foreign nations.
And this is 10 days later.
I mean, otherwise, we're sort of...
These are conversational fillers.
Little phrases we spit out to give our brain a chance to catch up with our mouth.
Like...
- Like.
- Yes.
ROADBLOCK:
And our President?
Between August 9th and August 19th, he stopped using "you know" and "kind of"
and started using "I mean" and "sort of."
But that's not all.
"Supper" became "dinner."
"Soda" became "pop."
One President, two fingerprints.
But it's a few words, right?
I mean, how much can...
Check this out.
Two press conferences, July 31st, September 1st.
See his fingers clasped?
Left thumb on top versus right thumb on top.
The same person never does this differently, it feels wrong.
What if the President isn't the President?
Look, if the Commander-in-Chief is an imposter and he's the one that ordered the attack, we have to assume that there's no one we can trust.
There is one man.
He's the reason we call ourselves Joes.

Sir, apologies.
- Sergeant Marvin...
- I know who you are.
Then you know why I'm here.
JOE:
It's not like I don't hear what you're saying.
But an imposter President?
How come when the General says it, it sounds crazy?
What'd they do with the real President?
We fear he's dead.
I don't think so.
You're not going to kill your best asset.

Negative.

'Cause you're gonna make a phone call for us.

If Cobra and Zartan are in the White House, then the world is at stake.
Storm Shadow.
You will tell us Cobra's endgame, or die by the same sword you once used to kill our master.
Your sword, given to you by our beloved Hard Master.
Do you deny that your envy and hatred drove you to shed the Hard Master's blood?
It's possible to feel so much hate you stop feeling it at all.
Like a fish not knowing it's in water.
But my path was chosen for me by my enemy who framed me for killing the Hard Master.
And my friends who believed it.
Why defend yourself to men too blind to see?
That is the Hard Master's blood.
But that is not... (YELLS)
Wait!
...my sword.
Arashikage steel does not break.
I have asked myself over and over who despised me enough to destroy my life?
BLIND MASTER:
I am sorry, Storm Shadow.
But who would stand to gain the most by framing you for this crime?
Your young adversary who chased you away?
Or the man into whose arms you were chased.
Someone who welcomed you, showed you kindness.
STORM SHADOW:
He needed me.
For who I would become.
A warrior of great skill and anger.
The man who betrayed me was capable of great ingenuity, violence,
but most of all, disguise.
Zartan.
BLIND MASTER:
Yes.
Tell us what he and Cobra have planned so we can destroy our common enemy together.
Try to hold still.

Yeah?
And what was your big plan, then, huh?
You get yourself killed?
Jesus Christ.
I listened to everything you said over and over again.
I never questioned...
I wasn't going to bury any more Joes.
I've got guns to clean.
Hey.

Well, he must be real proud of you, then.
JAYE:
He didn't believe in female soldiers.
I finally asked him why.
He said he didn't want to put his life in the hands of a woman.
I enlisted the next day.
Spent the next seven years trying to outrank him so he'd have to salute me.
Did it work?
He died before I got the chance.
I'm sorry.
I'm actually gonna miss the red.
You look real nice.
Hey.

Of you.
(LAUGHS)
What do we got, Jaye?
Zartan's entire focus has been this nuclear summit.
It has to be the key to whatever he's planning.
All right.
Well, then that's our target.
Yeah.
Guys, move.
(COCKING GUN)
(GRUNTING)
I think I'm faster than you, Snake Eyes.
Damn Ninjas.
(CHUCKLES)
Good to see you, brother.
Jaye.
Jinx.
FLINT:
Back up.
He's with us.
I am not with you.
But for this once,
I am not against you.
How many of our men has he killed?
We're supposed to fight with him?
The leaders of the world will gather tomorrow.
It's a trap.
Storm is the only one who knows Cobra's plan inside and out.
He can help us find a way to stop it.
But we have to work together.
ROADBLOCK:
All right.
Let's move.
Merry Christmas.
Makes you wonder about your neighbours.
Nice.
Open up that couch.
Anything?
I brought my own.
Nice.
Yeah, that'll work.
Hey.
That one's mine.
This really is Patton's gun, isn't it?
Gift from his family.
What an honour.
You bet.
I was actually thinking about something a little more your size.
Try not to scratch her up.
Idles a little rough in neutral.
I ain't gonna be in neutral.
Hoo-ah.
What about you?
DOD says I can't come out of retirement.
They didn't say anything about reenlisting.
Reporting for duty, Sergeant Major.
I'd like to bring a couple friends of mine.
ROADBLOCK:
Colton's team, it's our honour.
You guys take the perimeter.
Flint, Jaye, Snake, you guys take the flank.
Jinx and Storm, Trojan Horse.
Zartan will be holding the briefcase.
Storm will be the closest man to him.
But he can't move until we're all in position.
Everyone keep your eye on the prize.
We secure the football, we secure the world.
Snake, how's all that sound?
That's what I thought.
FLINT:
Okay, wait.
Hold on a second.
We still have enemy armour here, here, and here.
Right?
These tanks survive, we don't.
Leave the tanks to me.
General?
Call me Joe.
- Anything I missed?
- No.
Rock solid.
My orders?
The President.
- Brenda's with my team.
- Roger that.
Does Brenda get a vote?
ROADBLOCK:
Negative.
You need a pen?
I need your help.
ROADBLOCK:
All right.
Let's kick that ass!
Hoo-ah!
ALL:
Hoo-ah!
REPORTER 1:
A historic day for the President of the United States as he meets with...
This afternoon, the President is meeting with the leaders of the eight nuclear powers.
Never before has a President been so bold to call the leaders of the world together...
REPORTER 4:
These are unprecedented nuclear talks that most believed would never happen.
REPORTER 5:
You can bet security is at its highest...
We may be closer to a nuclear-free world than we have ever been.
My fellow world leaders, welcome to the hallowed grounds of Fort Sumter, whose proud walls saw the first shots in our nation's grievous Civil War.
Here, men rushed through the breach in a madness.
What better place to step back from that same breach.
Renounce our darker natures.
Forgive our staunchest foes.
This site is symbolic.
Not only for the peace we seek to achieve, but the conflagration we seek to avoid.
The Cobras who protect us today are dedicated to the belief that there is no greater peace than peace of mind.
- Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
RUSSIAN LEADER:
I'll say it again.
The world is safer with a nuclear presence.
I'm sure your electorate will be happy by our final proposal.
50% reduction by 2016.
There are a lot of leaders in this room.
But only one leader of the free world.
And he,
I, stay with me, asked you here with the goal of universal disarmament.
Nuclear zero.
Now, I was prepared to cajole to get what I want.
I'm now at threaten.
Each of you will clear out his nuclear closet immediately.
Failure to participate will be considered an act of war.
You're joking, of course.
This summit is over.
ZARTAN:
Then this is it.
This is it, boys.
This country is at war.
With you and you and you and you and you and you.
JOE 1:
Delta team in position.
Echo, you're a go.
JOE 2:
This is Echo.
Beginning assault.
The U.S. nuclear arsenal is capable of destroying each of your countries 14 times over.
Fifteen, in the case of North Korea, just to be sure.
And all
(BEEPING) at the push of a button.
(PEOPLE CLAMOURING)
ZARTAN:
It's true.
Yeah!
Yeah, I pressed it.
You have lost your mind!
It's all relative.
You got three minutes to decide.
MAN 1:
You got next watch?
MAN 2:
Maintain radio silence.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(INDISTINCT CLAMOURING)
We cannot, we will not leave a legacy of acquiescence!
- Bring the briefcase.
(SPEAKING KOREAN)
FRENCH LEADER:
Don't do this!
There can be no winners!
Ooh.
High score.
Let history record who was responsible for this madness.
Launch.
(SPEAKING HINDI)
(SPEAKS KOREAN)
Launch.
(SOLDIER GRUNTS)
Eyes on the Emerald City.
Jaye and Colton, you're a go for POTUS.
You all right?
Yeah.
You all right?
My cholesterol's a little high.
JAYE:
Jaye and General Colton.
Checkpoint neutralised.
You're on your own.
(RAPID BEEPING ON MONITORS)
Well, the good news is, no global warming summit next month.
Unless one of us cared enough about his place in history to unilaterally disable his warheads.
Hmm?
You know, in the name of the children.
Any volunteers?
No?
Fine.
Me.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Call your people to confirm.
You're a complete lunatic.
Says the man about to destroy Asia.
Come on, who's going to follow suit, huh?
Are you really going to stand by and watch as Earth is destroyed?
Abort!
(SPEAKING HINDI)
I figured North Korea for last.
(EXCLAIMS) (DEVICE BUZZES)
Got to love the little guy.
Gentlemen.
Welcome to a nuclear-free world.
I want to direct your attention to live images of your homelands.
Now, you're looking at an advanced weapons system we call Project Zeus.
There are seven Zeus satellites orbiting Earth.
Each satellite contains 10 hollow platinum tubes filled with a tungsten rod.
Zeus satellite 1-A approaching London.
Ordnance live and loaded.
Awaiting drop authorisation.
Now, to direct a rod to its target, we don't launch it or fire it.
COBRA COMMANDER:
We drop it!
Gravity does the rest.
Observe.
Satellite 1-A.
Three, two, one, drop.
MAN:
A rod touches down eight times faster than a bullet.
And with a force significantly greater than a nuclear warhead.
None of the fallout.
All of the fun.
(ALL GASPING) (EXCLAIMS IN HINDI)
FRENCH LEADER:
You will have to answer for this.
To your Congress, your courts.
Correction, they will have to answer to me.
What is it you want?
I want it all.
The Cobra revolution has begun.
By pressing that button, Zartan initiated an auto-drop sequence.
My Zeus satellites are moving into position over your six remaining countries.
Satellites 2-A through 7-A en route to targets.
The same button that begins this can end it.
But I only press it for a price.
Total allegiance.
(YELLS) (ALL SHOUTING)
JINX:
Block, secure the perimeter!
(GROANS)
Get the control case from Zartan.
I'm going to drop them all.
Head to the door!
Go, go, go!
Satellites en route to targets.
Beginning command protocols.
MAN:
Follow that ground team!
Go!
Stay.
MAN:
On your six, Cobra two!
Cobra one, Cobra one, I need eyes on!
Eyes on!
(GRUNTS)

Damn it.

SOLDIER:
We've got her cornered.
She ain't going anywhere.
(BOTH GROANING)
JINX:
Go!
ZARTAN:
Storm.
I never figured you for a Joe.
I'm very disappointed in you.
You're a bitch to hit.
(NINJA YELLING)
Traitor.
Storm.
You know, this sword was never intended for anyone with anger management issues.
(LAUGHING)
Boom!
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)
- What was that?
- Shut up.
- Ray?
- Yes, sir.
Check the door.
Give me a sit rep.
I'm on it.
(DOOR OPENING)
You two secure the entrance.
(GUN FIRING)
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
We're out of here.
Stand down.
I'm gonna shoot him!
I said stand down!
Be a good G.I. Joe and drop the gun.
We're walking out of here.
I will shoot him in the head.
Do you understand me?
You're not listening, are you?
Put the gun down!
Drop it!
(GROANS) (SCREAMS)
Easy, easy.
Put some pressure on it.
General Colton.
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.
- Sorry, Mr President.
PRESIDENT:
- No, it's fine.
Come on.
Let's move.
Here we go.
Roadblock, POTUS secure.
No casualties.
ROADBLOCK:
Roger that, Jaye.
You betrayed the Hard Master.
And made me what I am.
Yep.
Yeah, I can see that was wrong.
(BOTH GRUNT)
ROADBLOCK:
We need eyes on Firefly and Cobra ASAP.
(GRUNTS)
FLINT:
Courtyard clear.
No sign of him.
FIREFLY:
Commander, I have the case.
We are still a go.
How long till drop?
On schedule, Commander.
Five minutes to live fire.
Final targeting to begin shortly.
Zeus satellites 4 and 7 in position.
Zeus satellites 2, 3, 5, and 6 are locked on target.
France,
Russia, North Korea,
India, Israel, China.
Block.
Cobra Commander's bugging out.
No sign of Firefly.
ROADBLOCK:
I've got him.
Targets acquired.
Ordnance live and loading.
Zeus 4 is ready to fire.
Hatch is open.
(GROANING)
MAN 1:
Get him!
MAN 2:
Take him out!
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
(CHUCKLES)
You want that case?
You're gonna have to come through me.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
MAN:
All satellites have begun load for final countdown.
(BOTH GRUNTING)

MAN:
Launch codes confirmed.
Ten seconds to live fire.

(WIND WHISTLING)
MAN:
Joe Command to covert operations.
We have control of the perimeter.
Medical personnel are on the scene.
All Joes are accounted for.
We're going home.
The President is back safe in the Oval Office today, presiding over a ceremony honouring the G. I. Joes.
With the world back in order, rebuilding has begun around the world.
Those who stand beside us, the world knows them as Joes.
We know them as heroes.
(APPLAUSE)
Jinx.
Welcome to the Joes.
Flint.
Great job.
Captain Jaye Burnett.
I sewed with your father.
He'd be very proud of you.
MILITARY OFFICIAL:
Ladies and gentlemen, the G.I. Joes.
Hey.
For when you find Cobra Commander.
Where can we find you, General?
Just need my orders.
You know, we'd make a hell of a team.

We'll see.
Hmm.
Oh, man.
Come here.
Oh, God.
You're an idiot.
Nathan.
Hey.
Don't forget to meet me after practice.
Okay.
Open your textbooks to page 207.
I take it everyone did the reading last night.
How's it going?
The Civil War.
Key battles.
Can anybody tell me the significance of the date July 21, 1861?
Matthew Caldwell.
Uh, it was the first battle of Bull Run.
That's correct.
But can you tell me who won?
Well, it was a real mess.
But Colonel Thomas J. Jackson got the credit and his nickname Stonewall for rallying Johnny Reb and driving the Union back to D.C.
Very good.
But reports of the battle were not without controversy.
Since the Confederacy captured the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction--
Death from above.
You know I hate you, right?
No, I mean, just-- I just want to let you know.
How do you eat that garbage?
You mean this?
Okay.
All right.
I'm out of here.
Hey, Lendie.
Check this out.
Shit.
So, who's the dead man?
Hey, Matt.
Check this out.
It costs four rubies for a Dwarf spell.
That was mine.
What'd you say?
Cam. Cam.

What?
We're just messing around.

Heh. Very cute.
Do you have to leave today?
I really just want to get back.
My folks are in Palm Springs.
I've got the house to myself for a couple days.
Stay.
Come to the party with us.
I really can't.
I promised I'd work at the farmers' market.
I'll be back in a week.
We can do something then.
Yeah, you always say that, but you'll just end up burying your nose in another textbook.
Have a drink for me.
You like that one?
Sir, your change.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Hey.
Is that all for you?
Yeah.
You've been a huge help today, Holly.
Oh, are you kidding?
I love the market.
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
It's a madhouse today.
Oh. Sorry.
Oh, dear.
Are you okay?
Yeah, can you cover for me for a minute?
Nathan?
Excuse me, sir?
Did somebody just buy firewood from you?
Plenty have, all day long.
He had a beard, a dirty jacket, beat-up old shoes?
Oh, yeah.
He don't buy wood, he sells it to me.
We just do a little business round this time of year.
What's his name?
Well, he never said.
He don't say much.
I think he gets his stock over in Riddle.
They got plenty of hardwood out there.
Why do you ask?
Are you okay, sweetie?
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
Uh, but I have to go.
I'm really sorry.

It's my body.
Why do you care?
Well, you might as well paint a bull's-eye on your ass.
God, give it a rest, Dad.
Bill.
Look who's here.
Sheriff Richards.
I'm Holly Teller,
Nathan Teller's sister.
What can I do for you?
I saw my brother.
He's alive, and I think he's here in Riddle.
Let's slow down a minute.
You saw your brother?
Here in Riddle?
Not here.
Back in Jefferson, and I'm not positive--
You're not positive.
but I think they were headed here.
You're not positive.
Well, I saw a man in a truck.
Nathan was riding with him.
Ms. Teller, when family members suffer a loss, it can be very difficult.
I'm not making this up.
All right, let's talk in my office.
Have a seat.
Now, unless there's any new evidence, then the case is closed.
But I told you, I--I saw him.
Well, lots of people saw him or claimed that they saw him.
That's the problem.
Nothing ever happens.
Let me give you some advice.
Why don't you go back to Jefferson and tell the people there what you think you saw?
Because he's not in Jefferson.
He's here.
You're just refusing to believe me.
When your little brother went missing, it was as if this entire town was put on trial.
The FBI, state troopers, everyone came in like the Knights Templar.
Everyone knew best.
He's a missing child.
How could you turn your back to that?
You're just another outsider coming in on your white horse, making demands.
We've done all that we could do.
So that's it?
Sometimes your problems are your own.
No, it's semiautomatic.
Come on.
Let me just hold it.
Now, you know I can't do that.
Mmm.
Are you sure about that?
Look, I gotta get back, all right?
All right, then.
You're Holly Teller.
We went to school together.
I know who you are.
So, uh, what are you doing here in Riddle?
I was hoping to get help from the Sheriff.
From my dad?
Yeah, he's anything but helpful.
Is, uh, this about your brother?
Yeah.
Come on.
Bill... this gonna be a problem?
Don't you worry about it.
This doesn't concern you.
Mm-hmm.
These past few years must have been pretty hard on you.
Doesn't help that everybody wants to forget.
My parents have been really strong, but... even they're starting to give up hope.
Yeah, well, at least you still have your parents.
My dad and I-- have a terrible relationship.
I was kind of counting on him to show a little bit more compassion.
Yeah.
Ha ha ha.
Well, don't take it personally.
He's, uh, not really one for foreigners.
No, he thinks anybody who comes here is some kind of... threat to his little world.
You know, my grandmother used to show me these pictures.
Before that hospital closed down, this place really wasn't that bad.
I mean, there was a hotel and a bank.
Amber, I came here for a reason, and it wasn't to give your father a hard time.
But he was the sheriff when my brother disappeared.
That didn't happen here.
Those boys... they were from here.
Holly, they just went for a ride.
That's it.
Nobody knows what happened after that.
I know. That's not what I meant. I--

I saw my brother today.
What?
At the farmers' market back in Jefferson.
This guy had him in his pickup truck.
Before I had a chance to get to them, they drove off.
I think the guy lives in Riddle.
That's why I came here.
Are you sure it was him?
I couldn't get that close of a look, but...
I know my brother.
It had to be him.
That's why you were talking to my dad.
But why would...

Don't worry.
He's here to help.
We're in.
AMBER:
Found it.
"Myotonia Congenita.
Thompson's Disease."
Does that mean anything to you?
We've known about Nathan having Thompson's since he was little.
"Name of child, Nathan Bristol."
"Place of birth,
Riddle, Pennsylvania."
Birth parents, Gene and Sandra Bristol.
"Known siblings, Holly Bristol."
You were adopted?

"He had taken the life of Sandra Bristol, stabbing her 13 times in the chest and back."

That was the night of the fire.
The hospital became a place for the criminally insane... but not everyone in town approved.
Okay, boys.
Let's fire it up.
There were questions of security and rumors of patient abuse.
When a local nurse was killed... chaos broke out within the walls.
CAMERON:
The asylum was put on lockdown.
It's the way it has to be.
CAMERON:
That's when the fire started.
It could have been the prisoners.
Some think it was hospital administrators.
Others blamed a group of kids.
Many were burned alive.
It's not all peachy keen and white picket fences, like in Jefferson.

Holly was born here in Riddle.

What's that?
"Holly, meet me at the quarry in an hour.
"It's about your brother.
Come alone. Sam."
Did you talk to Sam?
Yeah, when you left me at the bar.
Oh. All right,
I'm gonna go get the boys.
No, wait.
I'm not gonna let you go up there by yourself.
Please.
This could be my only chance.
Can you tell me how to get there?
Wait. What exactly did she say?
She just said she had to take care of something.
That my daughter?
Did she at least say where she was going?
Could you stop asking me a million questions?
You guys starting early?
Sam?
Glad you could make it.
Who are you?
Where's Sam?
I'm the man you want to talk to.
You're not gonna find your brother.
What do you know about Nathan?
You know, there's a lot you don't know about our little town.
You've been snooping around where you don't belong.
Look, I saw my brother.
I saw him.
I know he's here.
We don't share our secrets.
Where is he?
You don't understand, do you, sweetheart?
Don't touch me.
Hey!
Hey!
No!
No!
Please!
Please!
No!
No!
No. No.
You made a big mistake coming here.
No!
Get off of me.
No!

Oh, look out!
It's Jack Abel.
What was he doing here?
Wouldn't expect him to do something like this.
What did you do?
He was gonna tell me something.
I know it.
Holly... what is wrong with you?
He knew something about Nathan.
He was gonna hurt you... and now he's dead!
Calm down.
All right, look, it was an accident.
What was I supposed to do?
We have to tell the sheriff.
No. Look, we can't do that.
They'll--They'll never believe us.
The guy's dead, Cam. We kind of have to report it.
There's no way in hell the town's gonna understand.
They'll protect him.
And besides, Amber's dad has been gunning for us since we were kids.
Cam is right.
It was just a mistake, especially with Holly being here.
Wait.
Holly.
This has gotten way out of hand.
Nathan's gone, isn't he?
I'm not sure.
I don't know what I'm doing here anymore.
I need to go home.
You kids been getting into trouble?
Amber, get in the car.
And you, darlin',
I think you've overstayed your welcome.
Amber, I said get in the car.
Hey, look, you don't have to listen to him.
Don't even try it.
Put that shotgun down.
All right, this charade is over.
I don't want to see the four of you together again.
Hey.
Hey, I want you to know that we really liked your brother.
And I'm sorry.
Cam and I, we were immature, and we--we didn't mean for any of this to happen.
It's okay.
I understand.
Holly, Hal will get you up and running in no time.
All right, kids.
Get her back to my place.
What, you're not gonna tow it?
It's a block away.
Push.
So... how's the college life?
It's different, that's for sure.
Yeah.
It's definitely not for me.
You must have wanted to leave here at some point.
Why would I want to live anywhere else?
People don't care what you do here.
We just party, and we can do whatever we want.
Plus, you know, what would these two do without me?
Foreign cars, that's my specialty.
Yeah, I've seen radiators like this.
Might even have one of these fancies lying around here.
Hey, Cam, it's your old coupe.
Hey, put that back.
That's Veronica.
Heh heh.
Nothing wrong with naming your car after a girl.
Yeah.
Sport, did you hear what I said?
HAL:
Oh, yeah.
Veronica.
What about this one?
'86 Silverado.
That numskull, always chewing up his tires.
Can you tell me where I might find the owner?
Well, I can't say.
We don't, uh, talk about other folks like that around here.
MATT:
No, no.
We're gonna talk about it.
How long have we been walking?
I cannot feel my feet.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
The mechanic said he drives on these tracks.
There's gotta be something.
Well, I mean, look, we've been out here for hours.
It's gonna be dark soon.
Yeah, we'll come back.
CAM:
Hey, guys!
Down here!
I think I found something.
Look.
Tire tracks.
This has to be it.
CAM:
Wow.
I didn't know this was up here.
Holly, hang with me.
Come on.
Look at this place.
Home, sweet home.
Come on.
Keep a lookout.
Whistle if you see anything.
Cam?
Hello.
Stay close.
Matt!
Over here.
Won't budge.
No shit.
Hang in there, buddy.
Hey, guys, I found him.
Nathan?
He's locked in the pen.
Nathan?
I'm going to get Amber.
Yeah.
Nathan.
What are you--
Nathan.
Oh, my God.
It's locked.
Can you pick it?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Um...
No.
I'll check it out.
We have to get out.
I'm not leaving Nathan.
Holly.
Holly, he's back.
I'm not leaving.
No, it's just a matter of time before he comes in here, okay?
Don't worry.
I will get Nathan out.
Come on.
Come on. Come on!
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We'll be right behind you, okay?
Be careful. Go.
What, you want to get rough, old man?
Come on. Let's go.
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
No!
H-Help me! Help me!
Help!
You're late, pretty boy.
Just making the rounds.
No Jack Abel tonight?
Looks that way.
What are you in for?
How 'bout 20?
20, it is.
No!
Holly!
Holly... your brother stays with me.
You... belong with your mother.
Yaah!
Oh, my God.
No.
Help me!
Somebody help me.
Please, what are you doing?
Please, wait.
Please just let me go.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Ow.
Ow.
No.
Nurse... prepare the conductor.
Two ladies.
I'm calling it a night.
Luck's not running your way, huh, boss?
Just rags tonight.
Clark!
Jersey, get an ambulance out here.
We learn through pain.
Okay.
On my mark.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
Okay.
Oh, God.
It's okay.
It's okay.
She wasn't lying.
She wasn't lying.
Sandra?
Oh, hey.
Hey.
I'm here now.
Hey. I thought I'd lost you.
Nathan?
Nathan?
Nathan, please say something.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
I'm here.
I have you now.
This is Clark.
We're at the compound now.
Jersey and Bobby are searching the grounds.
They found the Teller boy.
God damn.
Sheriff Richards!
Can you comment on the incident?
Sheriff?
Let's give him some room.
All right?
Back up.
There'll be plenty of time for answering questions later, all right?
Hey.
You okay?
I want you to meet someone.
Thank you.
All right, here we go.
1, 2...
Ms. Teller.
I need to know what happened up there.
Well, Sheriff... sometimes your problems are your own.
Oh, my God.
My baby.
Oh. Oh, my God.
Come here.

FRANCIS: 19 million, it's against you, sir.
2O million pounds.
20.
Here's the bid at 20 million.
21 million.
Back in the aisle.
SIMON:
There is a painting, it's by Rembrandt.
'Storm On The Sea Of Galilee', it's called and he's in it.
Old Rembrandt, he's in the painting.
He's in there, right in the middle of the storm, looking straight out at you.
But...you can't see him.
And the reason you can't see him is because the painting has been stolen.
Lots of paintings have been stolen.
They're still missing.
'Pride Of Lions' showing here on my left.
Thank you.
I start the bidding here at a thousand guineas.
SIMON:
It used to be anyone could steal a painting.
There was no need for a gun.
(WOMAN SCREAMS) (GROANS)
AH it took was a bit of muscle and some nerve.
And that was that.
But not anymore.
Those days are gone.
A business can't function taking big hits like that.
So now we have procedures and precautions and security measures.
Now we have a policy.
We have bag searches and magnetic alarms and silent scanners and X-ray machines and cameras.
Also we have drills.
And the first thing they tell us is...
Do not be a hero.
(DOOR THUDS)
This is a robbery!
Now no piece of art is worth a human life.
SIMON:
It's a sound piece of advice, that.
No piece of art is worth a human life.
But in the event of an event or situation we are to remove the most valuable item or items and take them to a place of safety.
I.E., the fast-drop slot in a time delay vault.
That's about all you can do really.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Come and enjoy the auction.
I mean, if you wanna let people in, if you want them to bid...
And when you're trying to ﬂog the star of the show for 25 million sterling you definitely want them to bid.
£650,000.
Sold to paddle 88.
Congratulations, madam.
Ladies and gentlemen there will now be a brief interval.
When we reconvene, our head auctioneer, Francis Lemaitre will lead the auction for Goya's 'Witches In The Air'.
Thank you very much.
(CHUCKLES)
So we notify the cops about big ticket sales and we even keep half a dozen Ukrainian ex-naval commandos in a van outside, just in case it all kicks off.
Or so they say.
Simon, are you coming?
I'm about to start.
Uh...
Yeah.
Here we go.
So, what happens, of course, is that just as we up our game, the villains up theirs. They don't just turn up on spec anymore.
We have precautions, they have plans.
They do research, they do recces.
They learn about our cameras and scanners and Ukrainian ex-naval commandos but some things don't change.
It still takes muscle and it still takes nerve.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Delancy's.
We are extremely honored to be selling
Francisco de Goya's wonderful work of 'Witches In The Air'.
Goya, the father of modern art and the first great painter of the human mind.
Let's start the bidding at 5 million pounds.
Thank you, sir. 5 million pounds.
An opening bid.
5 million, 500 thousand.

Take your time.

Follow the drill and let the training kick in.
If circumstances allow if, remember only if... (SIREN WAILING) ...:'n the event of an event or situation we are to remove, where possible, the most valuable item or items and take them to a place of safety.

How do you feel about going home?

(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Hey, Simon.
Franck wants to see you.
(MAN SCREAMING)
Where is it?
(SOBBING) I don't know.
I'm sorry, Franck.
You must have taken it.
You must have put it somewhere.
Yeah, I must have.
I know I...
Well, did you or did you not?
I can't remember!
I got hit on the head!
That you remember?
Yeah, I got a big fucking scar on my head to remind me, don't I?
What did you expect?
You assaulted me.
I had a shotgun.
Simon, the plan was simple.
All you needed to do was take the painting and bring it to me.
I know, I...
So, where is it?
I don't know, I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I'm sorry, I can't remember.
Franck!
Amnesia's bollocks.
Everyone knows amnesia is bollocks.
No, it's not.

FRANCK:
It's not going to work.
NATE:
What do you mean?
FRANCK:
He cannot remember.
NATE:
How did you work that out?
FRANCK:
Look at him.
Any man who knew would have told you by now.
Hey. (WHISTLES)
You know what?
I ought to kill you.
Why don't you?
Finish the job and put me out of my misery.
And then you can find your own fucking painting.
Riz.
Give him some food.
SURGEON". Well, his brain is intact on a gross level.
On a smaller scale, who's to say?
What I'm saying is we don't know.
The memories may come back, they may not.
All you can do is wait and see.
Isn't there something you can do?
For memory? Nothing. Except time.
Some sort of medicine?
There's no drug therapy for amnesia.
What about other sorts of therapy?
FRANCK:
Here.
Pick one. (SIMON INHALES) Ow!
Hypnosis? (CHUCKLES)
He said it might work.
What am I gonna tell him? I stole a painting and now I've lost it?
You know, you make something up.
What if that doesn't work?
Doesn't work?
Simon...
Doesn't work?
!
Okay, okay.
Urn...
That one.
Why her?
I don't know.
I like the name.
Right.
You walk across a wide open space.
Exactly the sort of place which might once have made you panic.
You are in Cape Canaveral and you are Head of Mission Control.
The rocket is ready to launch and although you are excited you will not prematurely release the rocket.
And now you watch as the spider leaves its web and crawls slowly across the floor towards you.
There is 30,000 feet of air between you and the ground and the sound of those perfectly functioning jet engines is making you feel calm because you know that you are not hungry and that these are feelings of stress and loneliness and that you will see the ball cross the green
and disappear into the hole.
SIMON:
Um, okay, um, my name is not Simon Newton.
My name is David Maxwell.
Uh, I cannot find my car keys.
(THUMPING)
Please stop doing that.
Stop hitting it.
Say your name.
Okay.
My name is David Maxwell.
Yeah, set.
Seriously, what if I say too much?
We wake you up.
(LOUD RINGTONE)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Mr. Maxwell?
Mr. Maxwell?
Mr. Maxwell? SIMON:
That's me.
I'm sorry.
Something the matter?
Of course not.
I'm Elizabeth Lamb.
I'm...
Mr. Maxwell.
Please.
Okay.
(ELIZABETH OVER HEADPHONES) You've come to find your car keys?
SIMON:
Yep.
ELIZABETH:
They're just in here.
(SIMON CHUCKLES)
I wish.
Hang up your coat.
Have a seat.
Have you ever been hypnotized before?
No. Urn...
No. No, at least not that I can remember.
I suppose you've spent some time trying to remember where you put these keys?
I've tried everything.
I just keep coming up against a brick wall.
Of course.
So I don't want you to do the work today.
I want you... to sit back.
And I want you to close your eyes.
We're starting, right.
I want you to think about someone else.
Someone who could do it for you.
Another man.
Like you but not you.
I want you to focus on him.
Let him take over.
Is he there?
SIMON:
Yes.
Is he under already?
ELIZABETH:
Do you wanna give him a name?
Simon.
Simon Newton.
Get him out of there.
No, no.
ELIZABETH:
Right, Simon.
Welcome to the session.
Thanks.
It's really nice to be here.
Now I want you to relax, Simon.
I like your voice.
And now your mind is starting to think.
So think about those keys.
And you now can feel them in your hand.
The shape.
The metal.
And you can see the color.
Blue.
They are on a blue key-ring.
And your mind starts to think about the last time you remember them.
I'm trying to walk and they're in my pocket.
And I want you to picture them in your pocket exactly as they were before you lifted them out and you placed them somewhere.
A safe place that, when the time is right, you will be able to reach for them and they will be there.
Where did you say they were?
In the wardrobe.
ELIZABETH:
What's in the wardrobe, Simon?
The... (LOUD RINGTONE)
I'm sorry about that.
Was I hypnotized?
No, you were just finding your car keys.
(CLATTERING)
(MEN GRUMBLING) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
DOMINIC:
Let me fucking get in through there.
Really sorry.
I kept thinking about the painting.
She just kept saying "keys".
Well, that's it, then, it can't be done.
She got his name in 30 seconds.
And she found the car keys.
Whatever is in his head, she can find.
What am I supposed to say, that I lost my keys again?
You're the clever boy.
You got us into this so now you think of something to get us out.
And you make it work.
(DOOR SLAMS)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GRUNTS)
(INDISTINCT)
(TIRES SCREECH) CYCLIST: Hey!
Fucking pedestrians!
Hey!
St. Pancras please.
You must think I'm stalking you.
No, I just think you've put yourself under a lot of pressure.
To be honest, I'm not here to look for my keys.
I found them, thank you.
I'm looking for something a bit more personal.
And I can't tell you what it is.
It's not porn.
I promise.
And I just really need to find this thing.
ELIZABETH:
Hypnosis is the perfect tool.
I don't need to know what it is.
(ELIZABETH ON STEREO) So I 'd like you to close your eyes and imagine you're in an elevator.
A wide elevator with velvet walls and thick carpets.
And as the doors close your eyelids become heavier.
And as your eyes become heavier and the elevator begins to go down you realize that this is the elevator of relaxation.
And now you're on the third floor going down and you could get out but you want to go on deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper into relaxation.
And you feel that perhaps you'll never want to get out.
It's so safe here.
So comfortable.
So relaxed.
I don't wanna talk to Simon anymore.
I wanna talk to the men who are listening.
The men who hurt him.
Oh, fuck.
(COUGHING)
(EXHALES)
(SIGHS)
FRANCK:
You feel safe?
ELIZABETH:
Safe?
FRANCK:
Yes.
ELIZABETH:
I don't think you'll hurt me.
FRANCK:
You're right.
Absolutely.
FRANC K:
It would be irrational.
And yet we are like that, aren't we?
AH of us sometimes stupid. Irrational.
It's fear, I think.
Fear of the unknown.
There are four of us but we are frightened of you.
You don't need to be.
I'm so glad to hear that.
Simon is an unusual subject.
He floats in and out of trance very easily.
But he's got a lot on his mind.
Fear.
Resentment.
Anger.
Why do you think he did it?
Greed, most likely.
Does he strike you as greedy?
Everyone is-- sooner or later.
Simon wanted the painting, that's it.
For himself?
Well, it's not like he did it for someone else.
Quite sure of that, are you?
Please don't.
So, can you do it?
Hypnotherapy will work.
But?
Only if it's a partnership.
Very well.
The finder's fee is 3%.
It's not enough.
See what I mean?
It's not about the money.
I have to have equal status in the group otherwise Simon won't respect me.
If you wanna make progress you really have to move beyond getting one over on people, Franck.
ELIZABETH:
Hypnotherapy is a means of altering unwanted or dysfunctional behavior.
The unwanted behavior in Simon's case is forgetting.
DOMINIC:
You mean he's doing it deliberately?
ELIZABETH:
Not in the sense that you mean, Dominic.
We keep secrets from lots of people, but most of all we keep them from ourselves.
And we call that forgetting.
(SIGHS)
Now, Simon I'd like you to close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I'd like you to think about being at home.
Home is a place where you feel secure.
In control.
You are feeling refreshed and positive.
(SIGHING DEEPLY)
And when the doorbell rings...
(RINGING) ...you feel a rush of enthusiasm.
Hello?
Parcel for Simon Newton, please.
Er... coming.
Hey, Mr. Postman.
Thank you very much.
ELIZABETH:
You are excited but you stay calm because you know that this is no ordinary package.
Inside this package is the memory that you have been waiting for.
And you know that when you open it up you will find what you did that day what you did with the painting.
And now taking your time you open it.
(EXHALES)
Now you're not going to rush because it's a big step even to have got this far.
Slowly so as not to upset the contents you open it.
(GRUNTS)
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
ELIZABETH:
Franck.
May I?
Yeah.
ELIZABETH:
Are you okay?
SIMON:
Fine.
How did you meet them?
Riz I used to buy drugs from Riz.
That was it really.
Well, the thing is, I needed money.
What for?
Gambling debt.
I was--I am... (LAUGHING) ...addicted to gambling.
(SIGHS) I was really good at it, you know.
I wasn't quite good enough, though.
And not really good enough isn't really good at all.
Not at that level.
I tried to give it up.
I tried everything I could to kick it.
I should have tried hypnotism.
You should.
Maybe next time?
Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping that my luck would change.
And when that didn't happen I panicked.
To various people in various ways I am in for money I don't have.
Never will.
This painting came in.
This fucking painting.
FRANCIS: Are you a gambling man, Simon?
Because I'll wager you, anything you care to name that I can flog this in the autumn sale for over 25 million.
Sterling.
SIMON:
And I know it sounds ridiculous, an inside job, but it just seemed like the answer.
I didn't know any criminals so I thought Riz might.
He brought me here.
He introduced me to Franck.
(YELLING IN FRENCH)
Franck cleared my debt in return for the painting.
I owe him a lot of money.
And I don't know what I'm going to do.
ELIZABETH:
He's afraid that once he's remembered, you'll kill him.
DOMINIC:
That's ridiculous.
ELIZABETH:
Is it?
Let's talk about killing.
Have you ever killed anyone, Dominic?
No.
Well, yeah, in Iraq.
Loads, obviously.
But that's artillery, isn't it?
You never get to see exactly who you've...
Nate.
Killed anyone?
Define 'killed'.
(CHUCKLES) ELIZABETH:
That's exactly why he won't open up.
His behavior isn't dysfunctional, it's entirely logical.
It's straightforward self-preservation.
Why do you think he cheated you in the first place?
So what do you suggest?
How do we make him feel more secure?
In an ideal world he'd kill you all.
That would do it, right?
Ideal.
ELIZABETH:
Most likely.
Okay.
But supposing, for the sake of argument, we don't go for that.
Then what?
He needs to see you weak and exposed to whatever it is you fear the most.
Nonsense.
Not gonna happen.
He needs to know that you're vulnerable.
If you're suggesting what I think...
I'm a professional.
I'm not going to put you on the stage.
The answer is definitely 'no'.
ELIZABETH:
Now the next voice you hear-- will be Simon's.
And he is going to say the word that I have prepared for you.
And when he speaks that word you will descend into your very own world of fear from which only he can bring you back.
Strawberry.

SIMON:
Strawberry.
(LAUGHING)
That was incredible.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Why?
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)
He doesn't know.
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
(TAP RUNNING)
(SIGHING)
FRANCK:
Shall I scrub your back?
How did you...?
Well, I used to I used to, you know...
So we got enough, I think, to make our boy feel secure.
Safe to remember, all that.
I think so.
Now we progress.
I like that, it's good.
Soon we'll have the painting.
And what about poor old Nate?
Does he still fall to pieces at every mention of the little berry?
No. Sustained post hypnotic suggestion is more difficult.
More difficult, but you can do it, right?
Not to everyone, of course.
5%?
Correct me if I'm wrong.
5% of the population?
Yes.
Can be described as extremely suggestible.
Wow, 5%.
Who'd have thought?
And what can you make them do?
Well, I'm just asking.
I'm interested.
All right.
Well, let's see, if you had the right person if you get a hold of them, dig right in if you get them under your spell if you work hard --and take your time and do it right you can make them want to do almost anything.

(CHANSON D'AMOUR)' BY ART AND DOTTY TODD PLAYING)
ELIZABETH:
There you are in an open-top car driving through the French countryside with a beautiful young woman.
And the radio plays some forgotten song and the sun burns the back of your heads in the warm wind and with every mile you travel all your problems seem so far away and so long ago.
And soon a field of sunflowers gives way to a low building of stone and tile.
The girl's dress, her calves leads you through a corridor to a vast room of paintings.
Caravaggio's 'Adoration'.
Cezanne.
Vermeer's 'Concert'.
Van Gogh.
Modigliani.
Manet.
Degas.
And Rembrandt himself.
(GASPING)
'The Storm On The Sea Of Galilee'.
These are the lost paintings all the stolen and destroyed, but now together authenticated, safe.
She takes your hand and leads you into a final room.
And it's in here in this magical safe place that you feel ready.
And you reach into the package and you lift out your memory.
The memory of what happened that day.
The memory of what you did.
And now safe and relaxed you decide to watch.
You decide to remember.
...fifty thousand pounds.
Sold to paddle 88.
I remember that day.
I remember.
I take the painting.
I carry it in front of me.
(ALARM BLARING)
And I cut the canvas free with arazorblade.(INDISTINCT)
I conceal the painting.
I carry on.
Remember no piece of art is worth a human life.
Sound advice that.
And I try to remember it.
You see if you can.
I discard the razor blade.
We are to take the most valuable item, or items, to a place of safe...
Franck?
! Stay back.
Put it down.
Simon...
He's about to look.
I can't let him.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (GROANING)
(EXHALES)

But you continue to watch.
You continue to remember.
(ALARM BLARING)
(GROANING SOFTLY)
I still have it.
I wake up and I still have the painting.
I get up and I go outside.
There's a noise.
I have to walk away.
I cannot stay here, not with this painting.
I feel my heart vibrating.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
My phone vibrating.
I look at it.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(GASPING) The car nearly kills me.
She's in the car.
Who is?
You are!
Oh my God.
Are you all right?
Elizabeth?
I'm not Elizabeth.
Shall I call an ambulance?
I remember.
(SNAPS FINGERS) I remember everything.
Look, why don't I take you to hospital?
SIMON:
Yeah.
Elizabeth?
(SIREN WAILING)
Shall I help you with your seat belt?
Why did you lie to me?
What?
You made me forget.
He's got it on him.
Look, he's got it on him.
Okay, maybe I oughta just-- call for that ambulance.
Open your jacket.
Who called you?
(FRANCK SHUSHING)
I'm sorry.
Will you let me go, please?
DOMINIC:
Tell him where you left it!
(SOBBING) I don't want you to go.
Never mind her!
Forget about her!
Open his jacket!
(YELLING)
What are you gonna do with the fucking painting? !
Just get him to tell us where he put it.
Tell us where you left it!
(SCREAMING)
(SIMON PANTING)
ELIZABETH:
Simon, can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
ELIZABETH:
Good.
Can you see the blue screen?
SIMON:
Yes.
I'm going to show you some images while we scan the response generated in your brain by each one.
(COFFEE PERCOLATOR BUBBLING)
The images will continue to run but you can override that by thinking of a particular one.
And every 10 seconds the least chosen image will be discarded until there ls only one left.
However, every time you think of this one you will receive an electric shock.
And the more you select it the higher the voltage.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Hello.
I slept on the sofa.
I was worried about you.
(CHUCKLES)
(GROANS AND CHUCKLES)
I had this dream.
Wasn't a dream.
I am so SO, SO SONY.
ELIZABETH:
What is a person, Franck?
Not my line of work.
It's fine.
Being obsessed with someone is fine?
(CHUCKLES)
No.
But to have feelings yes.
What we are is the sum of everything we've ever said, done and felt all wrapped up in one unique thread which is constantly being revised and remembered.
(YELLS)
Soto be yourself you have to constantly remember yourself.
It's a full-time job but that's how it works.
(GROANING) When you hit him on the head you broke the thread.
He's fixing it with false memories, with fantasies.
There's a space to fill so he fills it with me.
He's in love with you?
We call it transference.
(CRIES OUT)
I don't know what to say HOW.
Okay.
But where is the painting?
The same place it's always been.
Yes, but now you are the problem.
Yes.
But I may also be the solution.
When in doubt --try something traditional.
Traditional?
Okay.
Right, how's this?
How would you like to, with me, go out somewhere?
What, you're gonna screw him, is that it?
(GROANS)
You'll fuck him just to get him to remember?
It's not conventional practice, but under the circumstances...
Pick me up at 8.
Where would you like to go?
You choose.
I don't care.
Coffee's on.
(CHUCKLING)
Okay, but you wear a wire.
Don't be ridiculous.
(GROANING)
SIMON:
You can keep the rest.
Thanks, man.
FRANCK:
I don't like the idea of you being alone with him.
ELIZABETH:
I'm not wild about it myself, Franck.
So if you can see any other way to deal with this obsession I'd love to hear it.
(BEEPS)
ELIZABETH:
I'm glad I had you choose the place.
It's nice.
It is.
I haven't been here in a while.
Thank you very much.
So what do you recommend?
I usually have the steak, which is a lie.
I don't usually have the steak.
I I've never been here before.
Simon.
You need therapy.
I've been feeling a little confused lately.
I just imagined I'd been here before.
I could have sworn that I'd met that waiter before.
(GROANING)
I give him what he wants he's mine.
And after that, he gives me what I want what we want.
Just like that?
He isn't really receiving electric shocks. (GROANING)
(TAPPING ON GLASS)
He only believes he is.
SIMON:
Just here.
If you just pull in here on the left, thank you.
This is, this is me, actually.
Okay?
It's all right.
Okay.
Have a good night.
ELIZABETH:
There's a problem.
He's jealous.
FRANCK:
Jealous?
Of me?
That's so cute.
And that's why he doesn't wanna sleep with you.
It's complicated but that's what he said.
Yes.
I really wonder how he gets that.
Ask yourself.
Because now it's my fault?
I'm not assigning blame, Franck.
But you are always.
You can't do it because of this, because of that.
There is always something but it's never your fault, right?
"It's a partnership, Franck."
"He's got to respect me, Franck."
"We've gotta make him feel safe."
"We've gotta show him our fear."
"In an ideal world, Franck, he'd kill us all."
In an ideal world, Elizabeth, you'd go hypnotize the guy.
You'd bring me back the painting and you'd stop wasting my fucking time.
Wait.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
(MOANING CONTINUES)
(ALARM BEEPS)
(RINGING)
Jesus!
Fucking hell.
Simon, it's Nate.
We need to talk.
Come up.
(BUZZING)
(SANDMAN BY KIRSTY MCGEE PLAYING)
Right before you close your eyes
Whispering your prayers
When the sandman blows your eyes
I'll be there
I must remember never to forget that you're a criminal.
You got a boyfriend?
Now you ask?
Mmm-hmm.
No.
I'm single.
How is that possible?
I was in a relationship he was violent so now I'm not.
Got his address?
That's very kind but 'no, thank you'.
You should get even.
Get a little angry.
To be angry is to be a victim.
I've moved on.
That's the only real victory.
(SIGHS)
So why are you doing this, then?
Because it makes a change.
If you had to deal with morbid obesity and panic attacks you'd see the attraction.
Can I tell you something?
I'd rather not.
Gather roses while you may
While the bloom is full
For the blossom soon will fade
And the bloom grows dull
Right before you close your eyes
Whispering your prayers
When the sandman blows your eyes
Who'll be there?
FRANCK:
Hey.
(FRANCK SIGHS)
Listen, I... nun'---
...can you...
Can you see me again?
It's not exactly what I wanted to say, but...
I mean, you know...
Yeah.
I think so.
Good.
(CHUCKLES)
Be careful.
ELIZABETH:
And as the image grows closer and clearer you find you are watching what he did to you.
You are watching the terrible things that he did.
But, with every blow that you watch rain down upon you you become only more determined than ever.
You know that it's possible to change your life and move on.
That you will not let this define you.
You will not let yourself be violated by the memory as you are violated by the act.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Simon?
This all part of your plan, yeah?
What are you talking about?
The two of you.
Planning it together.
Gonna get it out of me and then dump me.
Simon, will you calm down, please.
How long have you been fucking Franck?
Where did that come from?
It's true, though, isn't it?
You know it isn't.
Why would Nate lie about something like that?
Because he wants Franck out.
He wants the painting for himself.
I don't fucking believe you!
Don't believe what?
The existence of greed in human beings?
For the past week, you've made every kind of excuse not to touch me and now that the moment's come, you resort to some insane fantasy...
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
Wait.
Wait.
I know what you want.
There's something I have to do.
(THE DAY BY MOBY)
I tried to know when to leave
She sits in the bedroom and grieves
(ELECTRIC RAZOR WHIRRING)
There's a sequence that starts all again
She can't get up anymore, with the pain
The combination of these drugs
Has left her hopeless and lost
She wants to count the ways
But she can't count again
And I will be right here
Till all the pain
Just disappears
And I will always stay
How did you know?
You told me.
Close your eyes.
E ELIZABETH Simon.
Relax.
When the silver shines so hard
I tried to poison my life
Always dreaming of the edge of the knife
(SONG CONTINUES OVER RADIO) She always looked backwards
And I couldn't sit here... (SIMON CHUCKLES)
You know where it is now?
Maybe.
Told her yet?
You wanna talk?
Yeah, it's about time.
So Simon we're all here.
Do you wanna talk us through it?
Yeah.
Good.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I really do.
I... (CROWD CHEERING ON TV)
I'm sorry, I just feel a bit nervous.
Come on, it's all right.
Okay.
Do you mind if I use your...
Yeah, please, please...
I'll just be a minute.

NATE:
So how long's this gonna take?
FRANCK:
It's all right.
I told him to wait.
NATE:
He'll lie.
I bet you anything he lies.
DOMINIC:
He'd better fucking not.
FRANCK:
Don't worry, if it turns out he's lying, we just kill him.
NATE:
Hang on, we're gonna kill him anyway, aren't we?
(ALL LAUGHING) FRANCK:
There's that.

(PHONE RINGING)
(GROANS)
Hello?
SIMON:
It's me.
Simon?
Where are you?
I'm at Frank's house.
Jesus.
What are you doing there?
Elizabeth, they're going to kill me. No.
You were right.
This is what they always planned to do.
Don't you see, this is why I had to hide the painting.
Simon, calm down.
Where are you now?
In the hallway.
The doors are locked.
All the doors are locked.
Go upstairs to Frank's bedroom.
There's a pool and a hallway.
Do you see the bedside table?
Yes.
Open the drawer.
No, the lower one.
ls there a gun?
Yes.
Do you think you can use it?
I don't know.
I've never used one before.
Do you want me to call the police?
No, no...
No, it's better this way.
Elizabeth?
Yes?
I have something to tell you.
Are you ready?
I remember.
I remember where I put it.
You don't have to tell me.
No, no.
I do.
I might never see you again.
I need to tell you where it is.
Tell me now.
It's in a red Alfa Romeo in the underground car park in Marble Arch.
I love you, Simon.
I love you, too.
Please, Simon.
Calm down, you've got it all wrong.
It's not what you think.
(GRUNTS)
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)

Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
(BOTH GRUNTING)
So where has she gone?
Huh?
Don't let her get away.
Not after all this.
I know, Franck.
I know what you were going to do to me.
She put that there.
It's not real.
She's not coming back, Simon.
Once she gets it, she's gone!
If I wanted to kill you, why aren't you dead?
Because she loves me.
And I love her!
(GUN CLICKS) (EXCLAIMS)
That's what she thinks of you.
It's my gun.
It's empty.
She took it from my apartment.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
I got this.
So who knows?
She does.
You leave her alone.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
He found it the first time.
The first time he came to see me.
Remember?
You thought you'd just found your car keys.
(GRUNTS) But you were right, it's in there.
It's in the car.
I took it to pieces.
It's not in there.
No, it's not in his car.
In the other car.
The red one.
NATE:
Where is it?
Please, I can show you.
I can show you.
(GASPS)
Get him dressed.
(GROANS)
Go and get it.
And take him with you.
What is this?
You're lucky you're still in, Franck.
Go and get it.
Bring it back here and we'll keep an eye on her.
Promise.
Say something.
Allow the mushy shit.
Doesn't give up, does she?
Go and get it, boss.
Like he says, you're lucky you're still in.
Drink? Yeah.
Cheers, mate.

(FRANCK GROANING)
ELIZABETH:
It's really silly of me.
I've been out of the country.
And I'm such an idiot.
Everything's a mess and I can't find the ticket but I really need the car.
ATTENDANT: £1,848.
Not a mistake I'll make again.
(CAR ALARM CHIRPING)
Not here.
Franck knows a good place.
Don't you, Franck?
You can drive.
On you go.
You, too.
You sit in the back.
(ENGINE STARTING)
Tie your hand on to the wheel.
Tie it tight.
Tighter than that.
Here you go.
(GROANING)
SIMON:
I would like to know what happened.
It's all inside my head, isn't it?
There's something hidden inside me.
What is it?
It's a memory.
A memory?
Suppressed?
Yeah.
Simon maybe there are some things it's better never to remember.
FRANCK Don't!
Franck, you're alive because I allow it, but I can change my mind.
I have free will.
Don't I?
Yeah, yeah.
Don't I?
! Yes.
All right, then.
All right, then, let's see if I do.
You take me to it.
So it's a year and a half earlier.
You wanna stop gambling.
That's all.
All in.
ELIZABETH:
You select a hypnotherapist at random.
And so you go to meet her.
Simon Newton.
Thank you very much.
ELIZABETH:
Hello.
I'm Elizabeth Lamb.
Hello, there.
Nice to meet you.
Simon Newton.
Hello.
Have a seat.
Thank you very much.
So...what would you like to talk about?
Now I have a moderate problem with online gambling.
I still have enough money to pay for dinner and things, though.
ELIZABETH:
You get along well.
There is an immediate rapport.
And so treatment begins.
But your addiction is hard to crack and repeated sessions are required.
Cheers.
We should do this with alcohol.
(CHUCKLING)
ELIZABETH:
You grow close to the therapist.
I miss you when I'm not here.
ELIZABETH:
Too close.
And so you begin an affair.
A strongly sexual affair.
You stay there.
ELIZABETH:
She knows that it's wrong.
She shouldn't do this, not with a client.
But she does.
If you look at the Sistine Chapel, there's tons of flesh but there's no hair.
The hair serves to remind us of our biology.
Our origin.
But without it there's a perfection, untainted.
Anyway, art moved on, as it must, it has to.
But, actually, no, it was Goya's fault.
'The Naked Maja'.
After that, it's always there, the hair.
Yeah, that's the lady.
That's modern art.
No perfection anymore.
Hey.
Okay, I get it.
(LAUGHING)
ELIZABETH:
She will do anything for you.
You fall in love with a kind of perfection.
The kind you like.
You're an elephant?
No, I'm not an elephant.
No, it's the Goya.
It's 'The Witches In The Air' that I was telling you about.
(CHUCKLING)
ELIZABETH:
But then you become possessive.
Suspicious.
Night and day you fear that you will lose her.
It torments you.
And you become jealous.
Who are you texting?
ELIZABETH:
Sorry, work.
You start to believe that you depend upon her.
That without her you will die.
You start to hate her as much as you love her.
And then one evening after you've accused her of looking at another man...
You keep your mouth shut!
Why don't you just sit down.
Don't they make a beautiful couple?
You can just look at him now.
Just feast your fucking eyes!
Elizabeth.
No, I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
She knows she has to get out.
(SOBBING)
She has to break it off but you won't let her go.
You persist.
You apologize.
You write long letters vowing never to do it again.
You weep, you call.
She is frightened.
I need to talk to you for 2 minutes.
Really frightened now.
Please let me come in.
And she knows if this goes on there can be only one outcome.
Hi.
How are you doing?
SIMON:
I just need you to let me apologize and see that you accept that.
I need to see that in your eyes and then I'll leave you alone.
I promise.
ELIZABETH:
In the end she knows that you will kill her.
(GROANING)
Please, stop!
Simon, you're hurting me.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
The police are not interested.
Lawyers advise her to change her name, to leave the country but she will not do this.
She will not be a victim twice over.
Instead, she will take control.
So she perverts the therapy you've insisted on continuing.
Simon it's not the gambling that you want to forget.
It's me.
You want to forget me.
You made me forget?
She makes you want to forget.
You're forgetting me.
You're forgetting us.
And you feel so much more relaxed.
So much more free.
Leave.
(SNAPS FINGERS)
And gradually-- day by day week by week you do.
You call less often.
The passions subside.
You're late for therapy.
Then one day you don't come at all.
At last you have suppressed the memory of me.
But you knew.
You knew I'd come back one day.
ELIZABETH:
Your memory is not destroyed.
It is locked in a cage.
And with enough force enough violence the lock can be broken.
It comes back, the memory.
Not completely.
Not entirely, but enough to drive you to make you feel you have been cheated.
Enough to make you angry.
Franck!
(MOBILE BUZZING)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
What did she look like?
You.
(SIMON PANTING)
God, are you all right?
Elizabeth.
No, I'm not Elizabeth.
Shall I call for an ambulance?
I remember.
I remember everything.
Why don't I take you to hospital?
As the memory comes back...
Okay?
Shall I help you with your seat belt?
Why did you lie to me?
What?
You made me forget.
Okay, maybe I should just call for that ambulance.
Elizabeth!
Will you let go of me, please?
I don't want you to go.
(SOBBING) I don't want you to go.

Look, I'm sorry, whoever Elizabeth is, she isn't me.

Hello, Franck.
It looks good don't you think?
Hanging on the wall.
I thought it might make me think too much of him, but instead I think of you.
You want me to send it back, don't you?
Or sell it and divide the money.
But you know I can't do that.
Not when it means so much to me.
Not when I've worked so hard for it.
Simon, you're forgetting me.
You're forgetting us.
Even when you have forgotten the one you love you will gamble lie, cheat and steal.

I'm 28.
I'm a teacher.
Okay.

And how long have you guys been married?
10 years.
Okay.
At least we're in agreement about that.
Do you have any children?
No.
No children.
Do you want children?
I do.
Okay.
Bradley?
I just think we need to be in a better place before we bring somebody else into it.
Okay.
Do you wanna say something, Lisa?
I love him.
It's just that I think people change.
Don't you agree?
Yeah.
They do.
I often feel like we become a lot of different people before we actually settle into who we are.
Especially when we're young.
We were 18.
I'm not the same little girl that was in love with him in high school.
But I still love you.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I promise I can change.
Tell me, please.
Just don't do that.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
Bradley, don't.
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna hurt him.
He deserves better.
Better than you?
Yeah.
Why do you feel that way?
He's a good guy.
He's consistent and loving.
But I feel like we're roommates and not husband and wife.
You met someone?
And he's showing you everything you've been missing.
This new guy, he excites you.
He buys you flowers and he tells you that you're beautiful.
He says all the things that Brad doesn't.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm not here to judge you.
I just think, if you're honest with me, then we can get to the root of the real issues.
I'd like to tell you a story.
About my sister.
If that's okay.
Judith.
That was her name.
I knew her so well.
We were so close.
We were raised in a very small town.
And our mother, Sarah, she took us to church five days a week.
And twice on Sundays.
There wasn't a lotta time for fun.
And boys?
Forget about it.
From the moment Judith and Brice met, something sparked between them.
They became inseparable.
They were the yin and yang to each other.
Now, Sarah tried to keep a strict hand on Judith, but Judith was in love.
And so was Brice.
Yes, she's asleep.
I promise.
Let's go. Come on.
Stop.
You see, love, for Judith, seemed to be different from other people.
For her, it was all-consuming.
It was breath to life.
Most times, they didn't even notice that Sarah was watching them.
Gonna see you tomorrow.
Somewhere along the way, she decided she couldn't fight this.
Maybe this was meant to be.
Or in her own words, "Maybe it was God's will."
Judith was so worried when Brice asked for her hand in marriage.
She just knew her mother would say, "No." But she reluctantly said...
Yes.
I'll tell ya, if smiles were dollars, they would have had millions.
Bye!
At last, they were together.
And life began.
They found this cute little place together.
I won!
No, I won!
They didn't have much, but they had each other.
So slow. Come on!
What you waiting for?
And they were more in love than ever.
Brice's lifelong dream was to work in a small pharmacy that maybe one day he could own.
And Judith, well, her dream was to become a marriage counselor.
But that wasn't easy.
So in the meantime, she found work with Janice Wise, the millionaire matchmaker.
- Good morning.
- Bonjour.
Good morning.
Your 8:00 a.m. is on his way up.
- He's early.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Merci.
Here you go.
Yeah.
Look at those shoes.
Yeah?
I didn't notice.
Thank you.
I wasn't talking about hers, I was talking about yours.
They look like orthopedic shoes.
Judith, we've been going over this for weeks.
Look around this office.
What do you see?
A bunch of women with hair from India?
Look at me, Judith.
What you should see is people in this office care about what they look like.
Unlike you.
We have over a billion dollars walking in and out of these offices looking for love.
We have a standard to uphold.
This is not our standard.
Okay, Ava,
I don't have to wear fancy dresses or fancy shoes to prove that I'm qualified to do my job.
Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
I have a degree.
- Yeah, you do.
- A degree?
- Yes.
A degree on the wall without labels on your back is nothing.
Where are you from, new girl?
Belvedere.
Where the hell is that?
In the South.
The South.
That explains it.
You grew up below the Mason-Dixon.
Okay, Ava, you really should take a Valium.
You really need an iron to that skirt.
What?
I did.
Say no more.
That blouse.
It's telling it all.
So does your dress.
What's wrong with my dress?
Can you even breathe, Ava?
You don't breathe in Herve.
Follow me, Mr. Madison, Janice is waiting for you.
Oh, my God.
Who's that?
You're killing me.
You don't know who that is?
No.
The third largest social media inventor since Zuckerberg?
Class-Meet?
What planet are you from?
What is he doing here?
Please, don't tell me he's here to get fixed up by The Madam.
She is no madam.
You need to bite your tongue.
She's a matchmaker and she's very good at her job.
Yeah.
So are pimps.
Come.
Please.
Stay right there.
I know she was talking to me.
Whatever.
Here we go.
Yes?
Ava, this handsome young man is looking to find a lot of answers as to how we do things around here.
Take notes, please.
Are you looking for a date?
I'm sure this handsome face has no problem getting dates.
Well,
I'm actually in between relationships right now.
So you could use our services?
Well, I prefer the old-fashioned way of meeting women.
You like to pay?
No, that's not what I meant.
What exactly do you do?
Me?
Yes.
I'm the in-house therapist.
This is Judith.
Judith.
Well, Judith, you are who I'd like to speak to.
Judith, Harley is looking to invest in my company.
We want to take Wise Counsel online and international.
Okay.
Well, before I make that type of investment,
I like to be quite certain of what I'm getting myself into.
I totally understand.
And Judith will take great care of you.
Ava, clear Judith's schedule.
Judith, please, answer any questions Mr. Madison may have.
Sure.
Come right this way.
All right.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
So you gonna start today?
I think so.
Thank you so much.
Don't thank me yet.
Did you show her what she's gonna do?
Yes, ma'am.
She'll be working the register and stocking the shelves.
I check the register at random every day, so you're gonna have to account for every dime.
- No problem.
- Random!
I got it.
Brice tells me you're from Boston?
Yeah.
You don't sound like you come from Boston.
Do you know Boston?
No. I've never been there.
Yet.
What part of Boston?
Roxbury.
Are you married?
No. I'm not married.
Do you have kids?
No.
So should I get to work?
Yeah, there's a box of deodorant under the counter that needs to be restocked.
Okay.
Nice meeting you.
Thank you.
Hey-
No husband?
And that blouse she's wearing?
And those boots?
She's a lesbian.
Does it matter?
I don't think people will think there's anything between us, but you never know.
People talk.
Yeah.
Matchmaking.
I don't know how I feel about all this.
I'm sorry?
Well, it's a dating service for the rich.
I just...
I'm not sure this is something I should be investing in.
You know, it's kinda strange.
Yeah.
So you agree with that?
A little bit.
Yeah.
So I shouldn't invest?
I'm not saying that.
I would never say that.
Like you said, it's a little strange.
A little odd.
Little unnatural.
Bunch of old guys paying to meet women.
I'm gonna shut up.
I'm saying too much.
No, no, honestly, continue, please.
I kind of prefer the old-fashioned way of finding love, but...
Well, I completely agree.
I do.
But, let me play devil's advocate.
So, more than half of all new relationships are started online in this day and age.
- Yeah.
- Right.
So it's obvious, she definitely...
She has something going here.
I'm just not sure exactly how I fit into it.
That's why I'm here.
To help you figure that out.
I think we can start with the Wise Counsel questionnaire that I developed.
And pretty much we use it to see whether or not someones compatible.
Do I know you from somewhere?
I doubt we run in the same circles.
Do you run?
Yeah, every day at...
Landover Park.
I knew it.
You run there?
8:00 a.m. every Saturday.
Start at the wheelhouse...
I think I have seen you run past me before.
You're that cheesy guy always running with his shirt off and making grunts.
- I'm not cheesy.
- Yeah, you are.
I get hot.
No, you're running with your shirt off so all the pretty girls could notice you.
Well, you noticed me, right?
Turn to page two.
You'll see the compatibility questionnaire.
All business.
I wanted to start with that.
I like that.
Hey, you.
How was your third week?
Any better?
Oh, God.
That bad, huh'?
Honey, what am I doing there?
I have a master's degree.
Why am I wasting my time in some snobby office helping old men get a date?
Is that what I busted my butt in college and graduated early for?
Like, it don't make sense.
Babe, it'll get there.
But, baby, I really feel like I'm getting stuck.
You know what I had to do today?
I just spent three hours with some cheesy computer guy named Harley something.
The Class-Meet guy?
Was he looking for a date?
No. Does everyone know about this guy except for me?
Baby, you should.
He's loaded.
Wow.
You sound like Ava.
Man.
I have to get outta there and start my own practice.
Babe, that's a long ways off.
I figure in about 10 to 15 years we'll be established enough to take that chance.
But right now you don't need to be thinking about that.
10 to 15 years?
Great, that's encouraging.
Thanks, baby.
And my mother called me today.
And she's coming into town for some revival or something.
Which is just what I need.
The stress of this job and the judgment of my mother.
You know she's gonna be bothering me about you, asking me,
"Judith Ann, have you been doing your wifely duties?"
Yes, Mother, I have been cooking for him,
I have been cleaning, and I have been having sex with him three times a week, just like it says in the Bible.
It says three times a week, baby?
Then you've been slacking.
Shut up.
I'm kidding.
I'm not.
And...
You know that little thing you do on birthdays and holidays?
I wonder what your mother would say about that.
My mother doesn't know about that little trick
I give you on birthdays and holidays.
And if she did, you wouldn't get it anymore.
I'm gonna get up.
I'm gonna go make you some dinner.
No. You know what I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
That $1.99 buffet again, baby?
Made my stomach hurt.
No, I'm gonna take you somewhere nice and fancy.
- Really?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.
Okay, I'm gonna go put my shoes back on.
I'm gonna take you to the $5.99 buffet.
All right, you!
All right.
- I did.
- Good.
And maybe next time we go, the lady next to us...
I was watching and she had the artichoke dip.
- I wanna order that next time.
- I saw it.
- It did look good.
- With the chips.
With the different color chips.
That looked so good.
- Now that.
- With the enchiladas, too.
That's a fine ass bitch right there.
- Was he talking to me?
- Babe, keep walking.
I know you ain't talkin' to me.
- Show some respect.
Kick your ass to hell.
- Baby, come on!
- You know what?
You need to be in church!
- Damn it, get in the car, Judith!
Pick up the Bible since you ain't got no good tact!
- Judith, get in the car.
- Your mama shoulda taught...
Why would you let these assholes ruin our night?
Ain't got no kind of manners.
What the hell they talkin' to me like that for?
This is crazy.
Thinking I'm just some regular bitch on the street.
Enough, Judith.
- Think they can talk to me like that?
- Enough!
Let it go.
I showed 'em!
Just let it go. it doesn't matter.
Their mama shoulda taught them better.
She shoulda had them in school.
- Judith.
Judith!
- Not hanging on the street.
Common whore!
- You stupid joker!
- Judith!
Baby, you been really quiet since dinner.
Did I miss something?
You didn't hear that guy?
Babe, I knew that was it.
Yes, I heard him.
Some things you just gotta ignore.
Why can't I ignore the fact that I didn't feel safe?
Babe, those guys coulda had guns.
We did the right thing.
I just don't like the way I feel.
Baby, I will always protect you.
I'd die for you.
I just wanna go to sleep.
I'm sorry.
I'm with you.
If you say "go," I go.
You!
Stop it.
- No, I'm being serious.
- You are the worst.
No, come on.
Judith, Harley and I have been going over the questionnaire you came up with and he has some questions for you.
You will be putting in some late hours trying to help him.
You don't mind, do you, mon cheri?
All right.
I will be in my office, darling.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So you have some questions?
Yes.
Yes.
Now, this is actually really good.
Thank you.
I need to formulate a program that's gonna tell me what kinda person we're dealing with just based on your questions.
That's a program I'd like to see.
Well, good, because I need you to help me build it.
I'm not a programmer.
Well, that's fine.
I just need your expertise on humans.
All of these questions here.
Now, they tell you a little something about the prospective client, right?
Yes.
As well as the people they will attract.
Okay, great.
What I don't understand is why are there so many questions here about past relationships.
Because you learn a lot about someone from their prior relationships.
You learn patterns.
You learn behaviors.
You learn whether or not they play the victim role.
Do they take full responsibility for their role in the breakup?
All that from one little sheet of paper?
Yes.
"Hmm" what?
I've never wanted to know the past of any woman I was ever dating.
Maybe that's why you're single.
Okay.
Last night, I went ahead and filled out one of these.
Maybe you can tell me a little something about myself.
Why would you fill this out?
You're not trying to find a date.
I'd like to see how good you are.
Okay.
Well, you are relationship-oriented.
You give a lot in relationships.
You believe in love, but because you've been hurt a few times, you've given up on it.
You are passionate.
You look like you got a little bit of a mean streak, though.
Very attentive.
Need a lot of reassurance.
Very observant.
Not bad.
Not bad.
So let's continue.
Page two is really interesting.
You need a ride?
No, I'm good.
Can you pass me my purse underneath there?
Yeah.
Thank you, guys.
Good night.
Good night.
Something's wrong with the girl.
What do you mean?
Did you see the way she covered herself up as she's leaving?
It's chilly.
No, something's wrong with the girl.
What, you don't think we made the right decision?
I need the help.
But she has to be watched.
Why don't you just take the whole bucket?
I don't want the whole bucket.
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes.
Judith, you nailed another one.
I did, didn't I?
All right, come on, let's wrap this up.
I gotta get home.
Okay- 50-50 chance that couple's gonna work.
-50-50?
- Yeah.
Training this computer to think like you.
50-50. 50-50.
Let's go.
Come on.
50-50.
Can I get some?
Wow.
Okay.
I'm impressed.
I'm thoroughly impressed.
My husband's never gonna believe that I'm helping out with stuff like this.
You were amazing.
How long you guys been married?
Six years.
I've known him for 19.
19 years?
Wait, so you're a very old-looking young woman or you met him when you were five?
Six.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
So you're 25.
26.
In three days.
Happy early birthday.
I never thought I would be one of those people that dread birthdays, but it just feels like it's a reminder that I'm not where I want to be.
Where did you want to be?
I thought by now, I'd at least have my license.
I'd be a marriage counselor.
I'd be on my way to starting my practice.
You know...
That's very noble, I think.
Marriage counselor, that's a wonderful career.
You should totally do that.
You're super smart.
Look at what we just did.
Judith...
I mean, you're bright.
You're intelligent.
You're motivated.
Set up a business plan and make it happen.
Now.
Did I say something wrong?
No, it's actually very encouraging.
And you know I could totally help you with this marriage counselor thing.
I mean, I have a successful business.
You can ask me anything.
What did you do different than the rest of us?
Like, how'd you become so successful so young?
I've always been ambitious.
Very much a workaholic.
So...
What does that feel like?
Lonely.
It's kinda sad to be able to buy whatever you want and have to beg for what you need.
My last relationship was back in college.
I had met a wonderful woman.
Completely blew my mind and I fell in love with her.
And she walked out on me
and I haven't really been able to rebound.
Since then.
Since college, huh?
That's a long time.
I didn't even know she was unhappy.
Are you happy?
Yeah.
Yeah, very happy-
He's a great guy.
Good for you.
Especially good for him.
He's a very lucky man, Judith.
It's getting late.
Let's finish it tomorrow.
There was something I wanted to bring up to you about the questionnaire.
Yeah?
I saw the questions about the relationships, compatibility, the hobbies, but there are no questions there about sex.
No,no,no.
I don't believe in sex before marriage, so why would we need that?
Really?
Yes.
Wait a second.
Where are you from?
It's not about where I'm from.
It's called I'm a Christian.
I was raised that way.
So what you're saying is your husband is the only guy you've ever been with.
Ever.
- Yes.
- One guy.
Yes, and my husband and I are very compatible.
How would you know how sexually compatible you are when you have nothing to compare it to?
I watch HBO.
I know I'm not missing anything.
I just keep picturing this same old, boring, turn the lamp off, fluff the pillows, always in the bedroom kinda thing.
What's wrong with the bedroom?
That's unfortunate.
If you were with another man, you'd know that sex should be random.
Like animals.
When it happens, it just happens.
In the kitchen.
In the shower.
In the office.
On a plane.
On the floor.
Are you getting turned on?
Please.
You need to go home.
Hey, babe.
I made you a sandwich.
What's wrong?
Okay.
Okay.
- Now, baby, baby, attack me!
- Attack you?
- Yeah.
Like an animal.
- Like an animal?
- Yeah, baby!
- Okay.
Just grab my hair!
- Wait, grab your hair?
- Yeah, and growl.
Yes, baby.
Come on, open this shirt!
Okay, no.
This is my new shirt.
Come on, come on!
- And scratch my back!
- Baby, hey!
Hey!
Scratch?
Look, this is weird.
We're not gonna do this.
I'm gonna forget you did this, okay?
Now, if you wanna growl at something, you can growl at this sandwich.
After we finish eating, we can go in the bedroom and do this the right way.
Okay?
Can I eat?
Thank you.
We could fluff the pillows, turn off the lamps.
You know, do it the way we always do.
It's going to be a great day if you're planning on being outdoors.
So if you don't have to be at work, or even if you do, make sure you get outside and enjoy the warm weather.
As we are experiencing some really nice above seasonal weather.
You can expect sunny highs in the mid-70s and it could reach even as high as 78.
Northwest winds are around five miles per hour, becoming westerly in the afternoon.
Now, this high pressure is moving in from the southwest and it should be expected to stay with us for the next couple of days.
Good morning.
- Morning.
- How are you?
Good.
You knocked me out last night.
I know.
I didn't do my job too well, if you're already up and running.
Just going for a Saturday morning run.
See you later.
Imagine me running into you.
What did you say?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
What?
What?
That's the trash-talking.
That's what I hear.
I'm pacing myself.
Well, who's leaving who in the dust?
Hey, watch out, watch out!
I'm so sorry.
You okay?
- What is your problem, man?
- I didn't see you.
Say something!
You gonna knock her down like that?
You'll hurt him.
Harley, wait, wait!
No, Harley.
No.
- Harley, I'm okay.
- Please!
I'm really sorry.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Just let him go.
Just walk away.
I'm okay.
Okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
No, I'm okay.
Let's get you up here.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- That's good.
Let me go slow.
Wait, wait.
- Okay.
All right, okay, this could be bad.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Let me call my husband.
No, I live close by here.
No,no,no.
No, I'll wrap it up, I'll call my neighbor, he's a doctor.
Okay, all right, but I still have to call, because...
No, either way, we gotta get your leg...
- No, no, no!
Put me back down.
- No, listen!
Hey!
I got you. Okay?
All right.
You good?
Yeah.
Wow, this, this place is just incredible.
Thank you.
So he's not answering.
You know, it's actually feeling better.
Well, it's not swelling.
That's a good thing.
I have to just walk it off.
No, let me see.
Just let me see it.
Hold on.
I don't know if I need all of that.
Just hold on one quick second.
Well, you're pretty good at it.
Yeah, it's just a little something I picked up in college.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
So was my husband.
Has a bunch of basketball injuries.
Really?
You talk about him a lot.
It's kinda what you do when you're married.
When he comes up, it's kinda in comparison to me.
No, it's not.
Yeah, it actually is.
You wouldn't be comparing us, would you?
Why would I do that?
Well, you tell me.
Okay, my husband is not up for discussion.
- Well, you bring him up a lot.
- No, I do not.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything about...
Look, it's just that, on one hand, I really wonder who this guy is.
And how special he must be to have gotten you.
And on the other hand, I wonder, does he even know it.
I wonder if he challenges you mentally.
Does he bring out the best in you?
Does he even notice you anymore?
- You know what?
I'm not...
- Judith, listen.
Just listen.
If I had a woman as beautiful as you,
I wouldn't miss a thing.
Like the small blonde hairs on the back of your neck.
Or how your left temple throbs when you're in deep thought.
How calm you get when you're really excited.
Like right now.
That is very sexy.
How slow you're breathing.
Well, I don't miss anything either.
Like the smell of jasmine perfume on this sofa that's obviously fresh.
Or those pair of high heels in your bedroom.
Those diamond earrings on this coffee table.
Don't play with me, Harley.
Verbal sparring.
You know that's a sign I'm winning.
Winning what?
That must be Brice at the door.
- Brice?
Your husband?
- Yeah.
I can't wait to meet this guy.
- Here, let me help.
- I can walk by myself.
I'm gonna help you, okay?
Here we go.
- See, I'm good.
- All right.
It's fine.
Okay?
Hey, be careful.
- Hey!
You must be Brice, right?
- Yeah.
Harley.
Nice to meet you, man.
Hey, babe, what happened?
I fell down when I was running.
Harley helped me out, though.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
Thanks a lot, Harley, I'll see you later.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.
Thanks again.
It's, you know, it's just...
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Babe, I was thinking.
Were you and Harley running together?
No, he just happened to be in the park.
Okay.
You look nice.
Thank you.
I'll be late tonight.
It's that mid-month inventory.
I hate the 15th.
Yeah.
Your breakfast is on the table.
All right.
Do I have any calls?
Flowers!
Susan, do I have any messages?
I didn't know the 15th was your birthday.
Happy birthday.
Here you go.
Hey, he remembered!
I left the apartment this morning so mad.
I thought my husband forgot my birthday.
But he didn't!
You are so excited about him. That is great.
Did you try something new?
With your hair?
I sure did!
I curled it.
And you see that green comb?
Right there in my hair?
Unfortunately, I do.
Is your fashion icon a Delta stewardess?
That's what you look like.
Oh, Ava.
- Is this wool?
- Yes.
-It's making me itch.
-It's a blend.
A blend of what?
Ava, can you just give me a break?
It's my birthday.
I tried to do something pretty with my hair.
I have these beautiful flowers from my husband.
I'm smiling.
- Just give me a compliment or something.
- That was a compliment.
He's on his way up.
Come on, we gotta go.
- Who?
My husband?
- No, Harley.
Come on, we really gotta fix this.
- Is that spit?
- Watch my manicure!
- Why are you putting spit in my hair?
- I'm trying to be your friend here, Judith.
When people look at you it reflects bad on me.
They don't think you have a mirror or a friend.
And they know we're friends.
My friends don't look like this.
They look like this.
Ava, I think I look really pretty today.
I tried.
I put on a little extra makeup.
That's not makeup.
That's make down.
I'm matching today, too.
You know, you told me about that.
So you see this gold belt?
The gold belt goes with the gold flappy things on my shoes.
And the blue shoes go with the blue dress.
Oh, my God!
What?
You're wearing flats?
My foot's all...
It hurts a little bit.
Push me out of the window, why don't you?
I would love to.
Harley's here.
Come on, we gotta go.
Enough with the coffee.
No coffee breath.
Come on.
No, no.
Nope.
We gotta go.
Hi, Harley.
Hey-
Hey there.
How's your foot?
It's fine.
Thanks.
Thanks for helping out the other day, too.
Yeah, no problem.
Brice just couldn't believe you were so nice to me.
He wanted me to thank you for that.
Yeah, no worries.
You changed your hair!
Little bit.
I like it.
Thank you.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You like the flowers?
You sent these?
Yeah.
Don't look so disappointed.
No, it's just... lt just said "Happy birthday, Judith."
It didn't say who it was from.
No, I wanted to tell you in person.
I was gonna deliver them myself when I came up, but I just didn't really think that was a good idea.
Yeah.
Smart man.
Yes.
Okay.
Come here for a second.
Let's sit down.
- Have a seat.
- All right.
Harley, I'm gonna be as honest as I can be.
What's going on?
You have plenty of programmers, plenty of employees that could come and help me with this project.
And yet you're coming here every day.
Why?
Judith, I find you extremely beautiful, okay?
And interesting.
And if I have to come here myself to be around you, I will.
I just wanna be involved with you.
Intimately.
And as long as you know that I'm very married...
Point taken.
He loves you.
I saw that when he picked you up.
He's kinda regular.
But lucky.
You just don't impress me as the type of person that would be satisfied with a man like that.
Maybe at one point in time, in your life.
But where you're going,
I just don't see that lasting.
You don't know him.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Crazy day today.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I was trying to finish up all that inventory.
Babe, I'm sorry.
It's the second year in a row, Brice.
Babe, I just got a little carried away with work, that's all.
Yeah.
I understand.
It's all good.
No, no, let me take you out or something.
No. I have this really big assignment for work and I got a lot to do.
Babe, I'm sorry.
Brice, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.
She may be weary
Them young girls They do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress
Yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness
Yeah, yeah
Oh, now, now
You won't regret it No, no
Young girls They don't forget it
Love is their own happiness
You're silly.
But it's all so easy
All you gotta do is try
Try a little tenderness
All you got to do is, man
Hold her when you wanna
Happy birthday, baby.
I'm sorry.
All right, girls, let's make some dreams happen.
Judith, you have been requested to accompany Harley to New Orleans for a meeting.
Really?
He's presenting to his shareholders and he wants you there.
Okay, well, when do we leave?
Oh, no, darling, just you.
I think he likes you.
Now, I know you're married, but just flirt a little.
Get the deal closed. Don't compromise yourself.
But just flirt.
I understand.
I know I don't know you very well, but I want you to know exactly what you're getting yourself into.
This is a big deal for me and this place.
And I want it in the worst way.
That being said,
I will tell you like I tell all my girls who go out with my guys.
Be nice.
Be aware.
Have fun.
But most of all, be careful.
I know you're a smart girl, but this is another league you're in.
Trust me.
A couple of senatorial retirement announcements this week, highlighting what has been a gradual rolling back of the GOP's...
Hello.
Can I help you?
Hi.
Do you think you can tell me how to get to Johnson Jewelry?
I'm a little turned around.
I'm kind of new in town.
You want East Jefferson.
This is West Jefferson.
That's on the other side of town.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
What?
We're back to this again?
Did you not have a good birthday or something?
My husband forgot.
He forgot?
I thought he sent you flowers yesterday.
No, they weren't from him.
He didn't even remember.
I mean, he tried.
It's just the second year in a row.
You are forgettable.
Honey, you have to make a man remember you.
I've tried to give you my assistance, but you don't want it, so get out.
All right, you win.
Win what?
The hair, the makeup, the clothes.
Do whatever you wanna do.
Are you kidding?
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
I have been dying to get my hands on this hair.
Come on.
Come on.
Look.
Look at the bags, the shoes, purses, everything.
I dream of this room.
Look at this.
Where are we right now?
This is the place that Janice sends the girls that she's not happy with before, you know, she sets them up.
So this is what I call Couture Heaven.
All right, let's get started.
Wow.
There's so much to do with you in so little time.
What do you think of this?
Wow.
What kind of fabric is this?
One that's never been on your back.
It's called expensive.
Good morning.
Good morning.
What's wrong?
Her ex came in here.
Tell him, honey.
I've been hiding from him.
Running from him for years.
Changed my name.
I moved here and...
I can't believe he's here.
I'm gonna have to quit.
Well, where are you gonna go?
I don't know.
I'm tired of starting over.
Look, maybe he just stumbled in here on accident.
Do you know how many people live in this city?
You can't keep running from someone your whole life.
You don't understand.
When we first met, he wined and dined me.
Made me feel like I was the luckiest woman in the world.
Then things started to unravel.
And I don't know if it was the drugs or if he was really mentally ill.
He just started to change.
And just became evil.
Like he was two different people.
He tried to kill me.
I just can't see you being with a guy like that.
Sometimes you never know who you're married to.
People start off one way and end up somebody else.
One night, he was on that couch...
I ran and I never looked back after that.
Look, Melinda, you can't quit.
What am I supposed to do?
We'll help you.
We'll pick you up and drop you off.
We?
Miss Waco.
What?
I'll help you.
Yeah, he'll protect you.
Don't throw away what you found here.
Do you know what we all need?
Is a Valium.
I have a whole room full of them.
Good morning.
Thank you.
Please watch your step.
Hello.
Hi.
You gonna fly standing up or you gonna have a seat?
Yeah.
Right.
I Will.
All right.
So, is this your plane?
Like, it all is?
- Like, all the parts and everything.
- Yeah.
Wow.
That's cool.
When we leave New Orleans, maybe we can head over to Paris.
Or New York.
All this work we're trying to focus on and you're talking about Paris and New York?
If you were mine, you wouldn't have to work.
If you were mine, you wouldn't be on this plane right now.
Your butt would be at a pharmacy.
That's the handout for the board meeting.
Champagne, sir?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Something for you?
- Thanks, I'm fine.
Look at you.
Champagne.
Private jet.
You look amazing, by the way.
Man, this view is just incredible.
What?
It's just refreshing to see someone experience this side of life for the first time.
You know?
it is. it excites me.
Whatever.
You know you take people on this plane all the time and excite them.
Just my ex.
This was no big deal for her.
I really hate being taken for granted.
Don't you?
Yeah.
How would that make you feel when she would do that?
The opposite of how this makes you feel.
How does this make me feel?
Special.
Important.
Wanted.
Am I right?
You should feel that way all the time.
This stuff didn't matter to her.
The more I tried, the more she shot me down.
I think I just love too hard.
I do.
I fall.
Before I know it, I'm just...
I'm gone.
What do you mean, "gone"?
Just crazy.
Crazy in love.
You know?
So I've learned to keep my true feelings inside because most women can't handle the kind of emotion that I bring.
What does that mean?
Well, I can come on really strong.
How so?
I want to make love to you.
Right now.
That's the kind of thing I'd say to her.
You are so beautiful.
Thank you.
What?
I was talking about my ex.
But you are beautiful, though.
You are.
You are.
Thank you.
One compliment does deserve another.
I think we are better off just keeping it professional.
You know we're way past that.
I find myself very attracted to you.
I find myself very married.
Happily married, right?
A guy can dream, right?
I can't stop you from dreaming.
What do you dream about?
I used to dream about helping people and starting my own practice.
But I graduated college and reality hit.
I don't really dream anymore.
You know all that could easily be reality.
What do you dream about?
You.
You ever dream about me?
I have a husband.
Yeah.
I know.
Do you want me?
What are you doing?
Harley, stop it.
I don't want to.
Harley, stop it.
Please, Harley.
Please.
Stop.
Get off of me.
Get off of me!
Get!
Get off of me!
Just stop!
Stop it.
Stop.
- You stop.
- Stop it.
Now you can say you resisted.
Are you okay?
I don't wanna ever see you again.
If you need anything, Janice can help you.
Okay, Judith, hold on a second, please.
- I will not do this.
I can't.
- Wait.
Judith, are you sure about this?
- Wait a second.
- I mean it.
Wait, wait.
Let me talk to you real quick.
Hold on.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Really?
- Thank you, son.
- No problem.
Judith.
Hey-
Harley, you remember my husband, Brice.
Hey, how you doin', man?
Hi.
That is a beautiful car.
Thank you.
Hey, Mama.
This your mother?
Harley.
Reverend Sarah Ogalvee.
It's a pleasure.
Thanks so much for the ride, Harley.
Appreciate that.
Okay.
Y'all have a good night.
Yeah.
Let's get you in, Miss Sarah.
All right, son.
Hi, Mom.
Sweetheart, how you doin'?
- You made it, huh?
- So happy to see you.
Sweetness, that was an awfully pretty dress I saw you in earlier.
- Yeah, you looked nice, babe.
- Thanks.
My boss gave it to me.
She wants us to start dressing like that.
You're not gonna say grace?
Okay, yeah.
God, thank you for this food.
Bless it and purify it.
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
In Jesus' name we pray.
And we thank you, Lord.
Amen.
Amen.
Miss Sarah, I'm always happy when you're around.
I get to have a home-cooked meal.
Daughter, you not cooking for your husband?
Yes, I am.
Well, she does, but lately, she's been working a lot.
Right.
With the man in the red, fast car?
No. I mean, I don't work with him that often.
And you know, he's a nice guy.
Nice guy?
That don't mean nothin' if he don't know the Lord.
"It's easier for a camel to enter into the eye of a needle
"than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Yes, Mama, I know.
You say that a lot.
But there's nothing wrong with being rich or having nice things.
Long as nice things don't have you.
Amen.
Well, our business is over anyway, so...
Well, then that's good, isn't it?
Yeah.
You know, baby, it's been a long time since you been to the house of the Lord.
I told her we rest on Sundays.
You know, with your job, you need to be in church.
Could build spiritual strength up to deal with those demons, girl.
I don't work with demons.
Isn't that what you said to me on the phone?
I know, but...
Okay, I guess I was wrong.
Mama, not everybody's a demon.
Well, I know that.
I'm just voicing my concern.
We don't talk anymore.
You don't call in for your morning prayers.
Well, it's just I get up so early.
You know, I have to take the bus every morning.
At 9:00 a.m.
Prayer starts at 6:00 a.m. every morning.
All the sisters be on the line.
I know you busy, baby.
I know that, but you could call in sometime.
Just once in a while.
All right, I will.
I will.
How long you staying?
I done got on your nerves.
I'm sorry, please forgive me.
You're not bothering me.
It's fine.
I'm just gonna go dry my hair.
Everything all right, sweetness?
Yeah.
I just don't wanna catch a cold.
That's not like her not to want her food.
Yeah, I think she's mad at me, Miss Sarah.
I forgot her birthday and now I'm talking about her cooking.
How you goin' forget her birthday?
You need your ass whipped.
Miss Sarah, you ain't supposed to be cursing'.
That's the King James Version.
It's all right, honey.
Eat your food.
You all right?
I can't believe you.
What did I do now?
Why would you tell her all that stuff?
She asked.
And you know how your mother is.
I can't lie to her.
- Whatever.
-It's like she looks right through me.
You know what?
I'm going to bed.
Do I need to go get my guitar?
Good night.
Is it important for your partner to support your hobbies?
Yes.
I think it's very important for me for that to happen, yeah.
Yeah, I think over the years, with all my concentration on my business, on success,
I was afraid that I would give up a part of myself, if I...
Are you listening to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I...
You don't want someone that's gonna change you.
Yeah.
Jeff stepping in front.
He's coming back, doing battle against his old squad.
Play action.
Down the middle. intercepted.
Come on!
- Babe, you see that?
- Intercepted by Kleinsmith.
Don't throw the ball in all that traffic.
Down the sidelines, out of bounds, across the 45 yard line of...
Indiana to 47.
Joe Kleinsmith.
He gets up limping off that play.
But he's got an interception and a 38 yard return.
Kleinsmith doing a nice job of just reading the eyes of the quarterback.
Quarterback's gonna tell you where he's going with the ball.
So is this what you wanted, huh?
You wanted to just have sex with me and just ignore me after that?
You come to the office.
You don't say "Hi." You don't call anybody.
You were the one that said you were married and you couldn't do this, right?
Right?
Why does it even matter if I call you or not, Judith?
Really?
Why are you doing this?
What are you talking about?
I'm not a man that likes to play these little silly games, Judith.
I'm not playing any games.
Well, if you want me, then you say it.
All right?
Live for once in your life, Judith, damn, come on!
It's not that easy.
Okay?
Where is he right now?
He's watching the game.
Touchdown!
Yes!
Put him on the phone.
Will you stop it?
No, put him on the phone, Judith.
No. Just stop it.
Why doesn't he wonder who you're talking to on the phone right now?
Because he doesn't do that.
If you were mine, I'd want to know.
Well, I'm not yours, am I?
Well, you could be.
Does he make love to you better than me?
I don't think anyone makes love better than you.
Tell me you want me.
Say it.
I want you.
Come see me right now.
I'll pick you up on the corner of Wilmont and 3rd.
I can't.
I can't be there.
I'm making dinner.
And it's what?
It's 8:30.
I just can't.
Hello?
Hello?
Pass the ball!
Look out!
Leslie Majors on the run.
Inside the Sycamore 40, out of bounds.
Dinner's ready, honey.
Mom, I'm sorry, that was my boss.
She just called.
She needs me to run an errand.
What?
I know, it's ridiculous.
I'll see y'all later.
Well...
Going down, getting the feet inbounds.
You see it there.
- That happen a lot?
- No, no, no!
Lewis able to pick up.
Can he make...
Here you go.
What's that?
You really are from the country, aren't you?
You've never even tried this before.
Let me give you a little bit.
No,no,no.
I'm just gonna stick with the wine.
You trust me, right?
Of course.
Go ahead.
All right, Well...
I've been thinking.
Instead of going into business with Janice.
You and me, we should start that marriage counselor thing.
Get that office open.
I'd do that for you.
- Are you serious?
Really?
- Yeah.
You would do that?
One catch, though.
You have to be mine.
What do I do about Brice though?
Okay, we talked about Brice, babe.
You leave him.
Harley, I already feel so bad though, about what we're doing.
Then why are you here?
You know why I'm here.
Why don't you just go home?
Get out of my house.
Shit if I'm gon' try and play these little games with you.
No, go.
What are you talking about?
Go.
You realize that you're kicking me out your house.
You know what?
Fine then.
Forget it.
Asshole!
Fine!
Fine!
Don't ever ask me to cook or come over again.
Bastard!
Don't call me again, you jackass.
You comin' in awfully late.
- Where's Brice?
- What's wrong with you?
Nothing, Mama.
My boss made me upset.
Brice is in the bed.
What's wrong with you?
I'm just gonna take a shower, okay?
You been drinking?
I had a glass of wine.
All right?
With that devil in the red car.
No, not with him.
And he ain't no devil.
Who you think you talkin' to?
You know you never could lie to me.
I'm your mother.
God's not pleased with this, daughter.
I knew when you moved here.
I knew the devil was gon' be after you.
I just knew it.
And look at you.
You're fallen.
Look at you, you're changing.
Please, baby, come back.
Now, you know I taught you the ways of the Lord.
You know better.
Come on out here, now.
Come pray with me.
Okay, Mama.
I'll come out there and I'll pray with you.
But then what?
Am I supposed to stop wearing makeup?
And wear dresses down to my ankle, and pretend like I'm all holy and happy, and sanctified for the Lord like you do?
Nobody's pretending, baby.
Yeah, well, I'm just saying it don't take all that to love the Lord.
Why you so disrespectful to me?
I'm just saying what my father shoulda told you long ago.
Now, you can just leave him right outta this.
God bless the dead.
God bless the dead?
So, Mama, we're still doing that act?
When you gon' quit it?
We both know he's still alive.
Yeah.
I found him in Youngstown, Mama.
And he told me all about you.
And how you left him the second you joined that church.
How you kept him outta my life.
So what do you gotta lie about it for?
You trying to turn this all around on me.
But it's not about me.
It's about you.
That fool out there, 'bout to make a bigger fool outta you.
That boy is gonna hurt you somethin' bad.
And he gon' take you straight to hell.
Well, I'll enjoy the ride.
Where you get that smart mouth from?
How dare you talk to me like that?
I done worked my fingers to the bone to make sure you had a decent life.
I done cleaned more toilets than you can think of and then you would talk to your mother like this?
Not today.
Not today!
What's going on?
Well, you know my mother.
She feels that the devil is after me, so she in there hollering'.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
"I will fear no evil.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures."
Brice, I need you take care of my child.
I will, but tell me what's going on.
God, Lord, Jesus and the Host.
- Judith, what's going on?
- Please, not you, too.
Judith, I've never seen her or you act like this.
Talk to me.
Brice, okay, I just want to go take a shower.
It's really not that deep.
No, Judith, Judith, talk to me.
Please.
Judith, talk to me.
Judith!
Judith!
Please!
Wait a minute.
Those are not my hand-me-downs.
No, they are not.
Take that for me.
Oh, my God.
You caught on.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
You caught on.
Let me see.
- I am so proud.
- Like it?
Yes?
This is my finest moment in life.
- Is Janice in?
- Yes.
Hi.
What, you don't knock?
Just the person I wanted to see.
Have a seat.
No, I'll stand.
I wanted to thank you for the job, but this will be my last week.
No. This is your last day.
I just got a call from Harley, telling me that he's out of the deal with me and opening a practice for you.
That's what we plan to do.
We?
Little girl, you have no idea what you are in for.
But I wish you all the best with your struggle.
You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you are in an existential identity crisis.
I did my research on you.
You spent those two weeks in Paris and all of a sudden you got a French accent?
Girl, we know you from Georgia.
Bitch, you better get your ass outta my office.
Now!
That should do it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
What's going on?
You okay?
Yeah.
Why are you so quiet?
I'm sorry.
Brice, what's the matter?
Melinda, I'm fine.
No, you're not.
Come on.
Everything you done for me here, let me return the favor.
What's going on?
I think I lost my wife.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Are you sure?
I can't even believe it.
I don't know what I did wrong.
I didn't know it was that bad.
I just thought that...
Brice, sometimes we can get comfortable with people.
And that's what causes the problems.
That's how it is.
But I didn't even know she was unhappy.
Well, she probably wasn't.
Most times you're happy until somebody comes along and shows you something different.
Maybe I did take her for granted.
Well, say you did.
But this is wrong.
This is wrong of her, man.
You don't deserve this.
You can't take the responsibility for what she did.
Because when people cheat...
I never said she was cheating.
She's cheating.
Miss Waco, I didn't...
Calm down!
But the lesbian is right.
Lesbian?
I'm not a lesbian.
You're not?
I'm sorry.
I thought that you...
The boots and the sweater.
You know, she's met somebody that's making her look at life differently.
Face it!
So what do I do?
If you see a mob fighting with bricks, you don't join in the fight unless you have one, too.
May I help you?
You have a prescription?
Hey, I wanna go home with you.
Judith!
- Hey, Brice.
- Come on, let's go.
Go home.
Judith, let's go, now!
Get up!
I don't think she wants to go with you.
Judith, let's go!
- Baby, I'm getting tired of this.
- Baby?
Get up.
- Get up. - Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get offa me.
Get your damn hands offa me!
Get offa me!
What is wrong with you?
Get your damn hands off of me!
Have you lost your mind?
Maybe.
I'm at home waiting on you.
And this is what you're doing?
Well, stop waiting, Brice.
This is how you do me?
You're messing around with this clown.
Baby, you don't know how much I love you.
Baby, come home.
If you come home,
I promise you I'll never mention it again.
Just come home, please.
Please.
Oh, you're such a good guy.
And I really hope you find a nice girl.
What are you saying to me?
I feel so dead with you, Brice.
I do.
And I wanna feel alive.
I wanna feel wanted.
I don't.
You took me for granted.
You did.
I don't just want a good guy.
I want a phenomenal guy.
You're not phenomenal.
What are you...
What are you saying to me?
We have someone I can pay to help you through this and help counsel you.
What?
Judith, you're not saying this to me.
I tried.
I loved you.
I wanted to love you.
And I'm sorry if I failed.
I'm sorry.
Fine.
I will help you pack your shit.
I don't need anything.
I'll just get my laptop.
I have everything I need, everything I could ask for here.
Bye.
Here you go.
How are you doing?
You okay?
No.
I understand what you're going through.
She was just so cold.
She wasn't herself.
Her mother warned me.
She was right.
Brice, I'm so sorry.
I know this pain.
What are you doing?
We're not attracted to each other.
Okay, you're just hurting and you'll do anything to make the pain go away.
Trust me.
I've been there.
I'm sorry.
I know it hurts right now.
And I'm not gon' lie to you, it's gon' hurt for a long time, and it's gon' seem like it's forever.
But you're gonna get through this.
I promise.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You coming up?
Hell, yeah, I'm comin' up.
I wanna see how this dude has you livin'.
Well, he should be at work, so he's not home.
Hey, move it!
You're blocking the road!
Go around.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Lord.
Oh, my Jesus.
We have to go.
Forgive us our sins.
Lead all souls to you, Lord.
Especially those in most need of Thy Divine Mercy, Lord.
No, no.
Let's have a little fun with this.
Hello, Reverend.
Save my child!
Sisters.
Oh, the Lord done answered my prayers, sisters.
- My child is home.
- I'm getting my computer.
Sweet baby, please stay.
Please stay.
You're not safe.
I brought all the sisters here to pray for you.
- We need you to stay here.
- I'm fine, Mama.
I know you think you are, but you're not, darling.
- Okay.
We gon' go.
All right?
I love you.
- You're in danger.
Let's go.
- No, sweetie.
- Mom, give me this.
I need it
Please, stay here.
I'm begging you.
- There's something on this.
- Mama, we need to get...
- Stop it!
- Damn!
Satan!
Give me that now.
What the hell?
Mama, you okay?
You okay?
- You're good, right?
Stand up.
- My sweet baby!
Now you see what I mean?
No, he didn't mean it.
He didn't mean it.
You need to stay here with me, baby, please.
- Get up.
Get up!
- Get your hands off my baby!
- I'm talking to her!
- Mama, hold on now.
Get up.
Girl, get up.
Sister Sarah, you tried.
You tried.
I don't know if she's hurt.
I don't know if her bruised knee is okay.
I don't know nothin' because you just jacked me outta there!
Bring your ass back here.
Come back here.
You come back.
Get the hell off me!
Don't you touch me!
- Whose side are you on?
- She's my mother, you jerk!
I don't give a damn about your mama, Judith!
Yeah, obviously, you don't!
The way you pushed her down!
- Get up the stairs!
- Don't touch me!
Get up the stairs if I wanna get up the stairs.
So you just gon' take her side like that?
Huh?
- Take her side?
- Yeah!
This is not about me taking her side, Harley.
It's the fact that you will not understand what it feels like to watch your mother thrown to the ground!
Look, just because your mother abandoned you in some crack house, don't mean you gotta abuse mine!
I don't give a damn what she did.
It ain't about what she did.
Shoot, yes, she annoys me, too.
She's still my mother.
Where is my shit, bitch?
She don't deserve to be treated that way.
Judith, you know that I'm just crazy in love with you, okay?
And it just... lt just makes me really upset when you're not on my side, okay?
I'm gonna just give you some space right now.
You leaving?
Judith?
It's just, this really is not healthy.
You gon' leave me?
Is that what you gonna do?
- What the hell are you...
- Is that what you gon' do?
What do you know about cooking?
Boy, this is what I do.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
I didn't want yo' ass to jump.
I'm not gonna jump.
Good.
It hurts like hell, though.
I know.
I know where you are.
You can cook.
You're a good woman.
You think you'll ever find love again?
You can't run from that guy forever.
I believe in love and marriage and I really hope you find a nice guy.
Brice...
I have HIV.
- Melinda, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.
I'm dealing with it.
I made the choice to be with my ex.
Even though I knew he was sleeping around, so I accepted my part in it.
I'm taking my meds, so I'm doing good.
But to answer your question...
No. I'm not running from Harley anymore.
Harley?
Yeah, the Class-Meet guy.
- What's wrong?
- Judith.
- What?
What's the matter?
- Judith!
- Judith!
- Judith?
What about Judith?
- My wife is with him!
- Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.
Judith!
Judith!
No. No, no, no, no.
Judith, baby, it's me.
It's Brice.
No, no, no, it's me.
I'm gonna take you home.
I'm taking you home.
It's me, baby.
Brice!
- Yeah.
- I knew you'd come.
He did this to you?
I deserve it.
You don't deserve this.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
I was so mean to you.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You think we can fix it?
We can fix it, right?
We'll fix it.
Okay.
Where are you hurt?
Right here.
I hurt your heart.
It's okay.
Come on, babe, I'm gonna get you home.
I'm gonna get you outta here.
I'm gonna get you outta here.
Come on.
It's okay.
L 90'!
YOU - I got you.
I got you.
My God!
Careful.
Get up.
Get up!
Oh, my God.
Brice, stop, you gon' kill him.
Karen.
Yeah.
It's me, Karen.
I knew you'd come back.
Come here, girl.
Don't you ever come near her or my wife again.
Karen.
Karen.
I'm sorry.
I know you have to go.
Wow.
What happened to Judith?
Well...
She's alive.
How does this story end?
It's still being written.
Did she get HIV, too?
Yes.
Brice?
No.
Thank you so much for sharing this story with me.
I'm gonna end this "almost" affair and stay with my husband.
Karen.
Hey.
Hi.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Hi. ls Brice here?
- Yeah.
He's in the back.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Good seeing you.
- You look nice.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you?
I'm good.
I spoke to your doctor.
He changed your dosage to get your T-cell count up.
Okay.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I'm good.
Where you headed to?
I'm going to church.
Mama's there waiting for me.
Okay.
Well, be careful.
And if you ever need anything, I'm here for you, Judith.
- See you next month.
- I'll see you next month.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Hi, little man.
He's so cute.
- Hi.
- How are you?
Hey-
How's my little man?
Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, baby.
- How's your day?
- Good.

DARCY:
It wasn't meant to be this way.
You know?
We make our plans, sure.
But life...
Life is what happens to you along the way.
You know, at first, I didn't want this.
I didn't want to connect.
I didn't want to get involved.
And she kept on at me.
"This is what life is. This is why we're here, to connect.
"To build."
We're here to build something.
And then we had Theo.
And then I understood that she was right.
We're not meant to be alone.
You know what she said to me?
She said that even the most damaged heart can be mended.
Even the most damaged heart.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Yeah.
No, I'm with Vic.
What?
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
I can't let you in until Alphonse is home.
Alphonse is on his way.
Where?
In the basement.
Oh, Paulie.
No.
DARCY:
It's Paul.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Why is the alarm off?
I told you that you should always have it on!
(WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
She said that she didn't turn it off.
Go.
"719, now you realize."
What?
DARCY:
What the fuck?
This shit is crazy.
Now he's killing us.
Call the locksmith.
And get that asshole from the alarm company over here.
"Now you realize."
(SIGHS) I know who's doing this to me.
(FREAK PLAYING)
(MOANING)
(BANGING ON WALL)
Killed for less.
A little uncouth to come without a call.
There's a better place for you to be.
Get out.
Go.
Am I gonna get paid?
Have you seen this man?
Paul?
Everyone knows Paul's missing.
I want you to think before you answer.
'Cause I'm getting to the bottom of this.
The bottom of what?
Three months of letters.
Three months of torment.
Not being able to leave my house without wondering if some coward is gonna sneak up behind me and...
Paul was looking into this.
And I think he found exactly what he was looking for.
But before he could come and tell me, my friend Paul shows up strangled in my freezer.
You've got a lot of enemies, don't you, Alphonse?
Three months ago you and I had our disagreement!
I raised my take to 25% to allow you to continue to operate in my buildings.
I started getting letters three months ago!
That's no fucking coincidence!
That's not fucking accurate!
You asked for 30%, and Lon told you, you could only ask me for 20%.
So if anyone was bent out of shape, it was fucking you, Alphonse.
Who's in this picture?
I don't fucking know.
Who the fuck is in this picture?
I don't know!
What am I supposed to realize?
What does 719 mean? What am I going to fucking realize?
What am I gonna fucking realize?
Darcy, want to give me a hand here, mate?
He ain't got shit to do with this!
I've been picking up from Harry for over a year.
No. He's a fucking liar so you shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna ask you again.
What am I supposed to realize?
I don't care what you think I've done to you, you are not sanctioned to kill me.
That much I do fucking know.
So it's not on, you even coming here!
"Not on"?
The term is, "Not cool."
It's you fucking English.
You always do shit like that.
Alphonse, just...
Well...
You also make your sevens like this.
You are not sanctioned to kill me.
Fuck it.

You're supposed to lie down and relax.
Huh?

I was relaxing so much I saw a white light.
(LAUGHS)
Well, if you see it again, don't walk into it.
I still have a lot of things to take out on you for my childhood.
(CHUCKLES)
It's beautiful.
I love the color.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Me too.
It's very pretty.

I got your note.
Hi.
Uh...

Hi.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Go out.
Go out on the balcony.
I...
I wasn't sure you got it.
I was wondering if I put it in the wrong box?
No.
No. It's mine.
So...
The note.
I just thought since we...
I thought it would be nice to finally meet you.
Beatrice.
Victor.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
No, thanks.
You don't talk a lot.
Not much, no.
It's okay.
I talk enough for both of us.
(CHUCKLES)
I talk too much.
Everybody says so.
Um...
You speak French?
I'd like to.
Yeah?
Sure.
Another language?
Hungarian.
You're Hungarian?
You don't have an accent.
I worked very hard to get rid of it.
So...
A job?
I'm...
Right now I'm dabbling in real estate.
The people I work for, they buy buildings in need of renovations.
Fix them up and run them.
Hmm.
(EXHALES SOFTLY)
YOU?
A jab?
Yeah.
I was involved in a car accident last year.
I was a beautician before.
They rebuilt part of my face.
But it's kind of hard to give advice on beauty now.
And...
I have to smile a lot in my job.
Most of the time, it hurts to smile.
I don't get to smile so much in my work.
No?
No.
Maybe you and I should switch jobs.
Yeah.
So, what else?
I swear sometimes.
Especially when I drink.
Me too.
Fuck.
Shit.
(LAUGHING)
Careful.
You're smiling.
Tonight it's worth it.
I want to take you somewhere.
(LAUGHS)
So where are we going?
Are we going to a club?
No.
No?
Very cold.
Very cold.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, then are we going to a park?
Hmm... (LAUGHS)
Warmer.
I thought you talk a lot?
I thought you don't.
Must be the company.
Usually, I don't.
You can turn here.
Pull over.
Just there.
You're afraid I'll think you came tonight because you felt sorry for me.
You don't have to play these games, Victor.
I know why you really came.
You're just being careful.
You want to find out if the girl who's been watching you saw what you did.
I saw you kill this man.
I saw you strangle him.
I saw you take him away.
Now you're trying to clean up a mess that cannot be cleaned up.
But, I...
I think your secret will be safe with me.
This is the man who hit my car when he was drunk.
This is the man who did this to me.
I want you to kill him.
As you did with the man in your apartment.
Wait a minute.
No.
If you don't do it, I'll call the police and tell them what I saw.
What the fuck are you...
His BMW.
It's fixed.
As if it had never happened.
But I can't be fixed.
He served three weeks.
Three weeks for what he did to me.
Stupid judge, he sat there and he looked at my face.
I want it done.
If you don't do it, I'll call the police and I'll tell them what I saw.
You'll do it!
You want to save yourself?
Do it!
Fuck.
He didn't pay.
I understand.
He didn't pay.
Stop saying that!
I understand!
Are you gonna do it?
What I did, it has nothing to do with you.
You have to do this!
He ruined my life.
I have nothing.
I am nothing.
I want it done as soon as possible.
Then I will forget.
I will begin my life.
And I will forget that I ever met you.
Do you know what it is to kill a man?
I will forget that I ever met you.
It's not a bug!
It's not a rat!
I would never kill a bug or a rat!
He's much worse than these things!
You don't know what you're getting into with me!
You have no fucking idea!
(PULLS HAND BREAK)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(CARS HONKING)
I could have called the police.
I saved your life.
Now you're gonna give me back mine.
If you're not going to kill me you don't have a choice.

You look good.
It's good to see you.
Were you worried I was going to forget your name?
Ah...

You forget what it's like.
(MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
It's Andras who gave us the body for your grave.
VICTOR:
Whose body?
Someone who deserved it, I'm sure.
(SPEAKING HUNGARIAN)
Is this where the whores are kept?
(MAN LAUGHS)
No, no, you are looking for your mother's boat.
Two down.
We met.
Two days after when they left you for dead.
VICTOR:
Yeah.
ANDRAS:
Soviet modified Dragunov.
Shoots 7.62 by 5.4 rounds.
With all Russian PSO scopes.
Comes with bayonet suppressor as well.
Heavier than I expected.
I'll take it.
(MURMURING)
Okay.
All set.
What did he say?
Andras?
For 14 months you've infiltrated Alphonse.
They wanted to know why you've been waiting for so long to do what needs to be done.
He said if he was lucky enough to be standing, like you are, he'd want revenge, too.
But we're all worried you wait too long.
Always kill the devil quickly when you find him.
That was his advice.
I said you wanted to be close enough to watch him suffer.
But I really don't know the reason you're waiting.

(MATILDE KISSING DELPHINE)
VICTOR:
Bigger smile than that.
That's not the biggest smile you have.
So?
Nothing.
No one has seen your brother.
It's been two weeks, lam telling you.
He never goes more than a few days without calling me.
You know him.
Sometimes he likes to get away.
No. Something is wrong.
What have I done to you?
Where have you taken me?
I need foodstuffs.
(RATS SQUEALING)
(GASPS)
I can help you.
If you let me go, he will spare you.
My brother, he will not stop looking for me.
And he will find you.
(SOBBING)
Even if you get his money, even if they pay, he will find you.
(CAMERA CLICKING) (SOBS)
You don't know who you're messing with!
He will kill you!

If you put a bag over your head, we might hook up with you.
(ALL LAUGHING)
You have to take off your shoes.
My mom likes to keep the floor clean.
BEATRICE:
How long will it take?
Long enough to be prepared.
You say he goes to this bar every night?
Yeah.
You know where he works?
He's looking for work.
As much as I could find out, I did.
I never thought about it before.
Revenge.
But when I saw you kill that man in your apartment,
I knew I had my answer.
Why did you do it?
I just want to know more about you.
I'm not here by choice.
Oh!
We have company.
She can't hear us.
She lost most of her hearing as a child.
(WOMEN SPEAKING FRENCH)
Oh, I forgot my cookies in the oven.
I took them out for you, Mom.
Oh, okay.
I'm looking for my hearing aids.
Mom, I'd like you to meet Victor.
Oh!
Hello, Victor.
Nice to meet you.
Well, you look good.
You want to stay for lunch?
We're having chicken.
Lemon chicken.
It's very good.
And cookies, too.
We love cookies in this house.
You want cookies?
I can't stay, madame.
Oh, I want to show you something.
Pictures of Beatrice.
You can see she has excellent genes.
Isn't she pretty?
You see how beautiful she is?
Mmm.

Got any grass?
That depends.

You see anyone take a photo up there?
Already told.
Already told who?
Another guy.
A guy like you.
This is my friend Paul.
Did you tell him?
(RINGS)
ALPHONSE:
Hello.
GORDON:
It's Lon.
You know, people are flipping out.
You weren't sanctioned to do Harry.
Or his men.
Or leave a house full of dead Jamaicans!
No, I told you...
Can you try to imagine...
Look, Lon...
Imagine what the fuck I'm dealing with?
No. You need to come see me right now.
You don't appreciate the severity of this.
You come now.
I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.
So...
We got dead Jamaicans, huh?
I'm listening.
Well, Lon, for the last three months, Harry was messing with me.
Trying to freak me out.
Sending little notes like this with pictures, and threats and fucked-up shit.
I don't think he was too happy with the percentage deal.
Okay.)'-
I went in there to get answers, not dead Jamaicans.
Mmm-hmm.
Turned out that way.
I lost two guys.
And truth is, I could have been just as dead as both of them.
You know Joe Bragg?
And Herbert?
Lowell Khan.
And Weinberg?
They're my colleagues.
Yeah.
Each received photos like these.
(EARPIECE BUZZING)
Yeah?
DARCY ON PHONE:
Yo, Vic.
Where you at?
I'm in the middle of something.
Hey, listen, I was right.
Alphonse is still in danger.
This was not Harry and his men doing this shit.
How do you know that?
You know Cafe Cora?
Can you get there?
I can find it.
Yeah, look, Alphonse is there with Lon Gordon.
I'm gonna call the rest of the crew and get them down there, all right?
How'd you know it wasn't Harry?
I'll be there in five.
Fuck.
Yo, Terry.
Yeah?
I'm gonna look at these photos another way.
'Cause whoever's doing this is taking it seriously enough now to let us know that the loans to you, they're not secure.
That's respect enough to let us know his intentions.
You're not gonna be around.
You may not be around to collect.
Lon, that's exactly what Harry wanted you to think.
I got a note, too.
This morning.
It's addressed to you.
Englishmen and Jamaicans, they don't send notes like this.
Not after they've been killed in their own house.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
And this key was taped to it.
You know what that key is for?
I want you to get the books and the deeds together for me now, all right?
Every building you owe us for.
You understand this, don't you?
So the uptown buildings, you're pulling out of the deal?
We're not pulling out, Alphonse.
You're just in no condition right now to pull in.
Shit!
TERRY:
Alphonse...
Not right now.

We need to go.

You told me to get here.
I'm sorry I made him late.
What's going on?
See you later.
DARCY:
Did you see anyone running here, Vic?
No.
Oh, shit!
He took out Blotto, Goff and even Charles.
Who?
KILROY: We lost him.
Fuck!
You guys all right?
Tell him what you told me about the cab.
This guy in the building, he saw a man take this photo from the stairwell.
Then they see him get into a cab.
A gypsy cab.
Paul was there, too.
He found out the same thing.
It must've led him to something, because he was wasted for it.
Find out where the cab went.
What did you do that for?
What I do what for?
Go looking with the pictures.
You've only been on this crew a month longer than I have.
What if all this shit that's happening to Alphonse is because of something that went down before you came, huh?
This is an opportunity of magnumus proportions to me.
How's that?
Of finding my next step in the organization.
Yeah, well, there might not be much of an organization left.
I could run this place for him, Victor.
Better than Terry, a whole lot better than fucking Kilroy.
(SIRENS WAILING)
I ain't joking around.
If I could just crack this shit for...
This is serious shit, Darcy.
Have enough money to buy Lise and Theo what they need.
Move up the ladder.
What the fuck!
It's Lise's car.
Mine's in the shop.
What?
Are you back with her?
Yeah, she's acknowledging me.
It's a start, right?
I promised her I'd make a plan.
Get ahead.
For her and for Theo.
Just don't get too smart.
You saw what happened to Paul.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
I'm smarter than Paul.
I'm tired of being taken for a fucking douche.
I saw Alphonse respected me back there.
Oh, yeah?
I saw it in his eyes.
All right.
We're good.
That's it.

Hello.
This is Victor, is Beatrice...
Hello.
This is Victor.
ls Beatrice there?
What?
There's no answer, no one is there.
BEATRICE:
Hello.
It's me.
I believe you have something of mine?
Yeah.
Why did you follow me?
It's not the first time.
I wanted to find out more about you.
I think it's lucky I did.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
You want some water?
Sure.
BEATRICE:
So, who are you?
My real name is Laszlo Kerik.
I was born in Hungary.
A few years ago my wife and I came to America.
I was an engineer before.
We came here looking for work.
We took an apartment in a building.
It was a building they wanted to control.
The man I saw?
They got most people out of the building.
One night they came and they fired some shots.
To scare us.
So we would leave.
A bullet went through a wall, and my daughter was killed while she slept.
We were going to testify.
My wife and I.
The man responsible for it all, Alphonse, he gave his orders to make sure he never went to trial.
And they were followed.
He was afraid to use his own guys, so they sent a crew of Albanians after us.
They killed my wife, and they thought they killed me, too.
And they should have made sure of it.
Cigarette?
Yeah.
When I manage to forget what happened to me, when there are no mirrors, and no people that reminds me,
when my mom makes me laugh...
In these moments,
I have hope.
Maman says that I...
That it's these moments that makes the pain bearable.
These moments.
I should try and find them where I can and hang onto them.
But they're fleeting.
And then I remember, and I'm filled with so much hate
so I want to set the whole world on fire.
I'm sorry I made you tell me about your family.
I don't want to be one of those people that reminds you.
When you're the one who is going to help me forget.
These men, they don't seem easy to beat.
And you might have used up all your luck.
So...
It's yellow...
Uh-uh.
Chartreuse.
Keep it.
I need you around.
Rabbits don't come in chartreuse.
Did you eat the cookies?
No.
Maman makes a good cookie.
I only ask you to return the Tupperware.
She likes her Tupperware.
Have you made any progress?
I will.
I know.
Because I realize now that if I call the police and tell them what I saw, it's not prison you're afraid of.
It's that you won't get to finish your revenge.
I'm going to sleep in my own bed.
And why are you going to sleep in your own bed?
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
VICTOR:
Why, baby?
Tell me once more, why?
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
(DELPHINE GIGGLES)
VICTOR:
Bigger smile than that!
That's not the biggest smile you have.
MATILDE:
And why are you going to sleep in your own bed?
DELPHINE:
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
VICTOR:
Why, baby?
Tell me once more.
Why?
Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
(DELPHINE GIGGLING)
I'm so happy that you're here.
Yeah.
I just needed some time, Florence.
Now I'm going to cry.
I was worried when you didn't contact my friend.
Nicholas, the therapist.
Oh, yeah.
He really did wonders helping me out.
He could help you.
I found someone else.
As long as you're getting the help you need.
Yeah.
I'm in good hands.

Then there is nothing wrong with your remote.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
There's a barrier.
Your signal won't get through.
The AR 43 is an IR unit that is used in most banks and government buildings.
What is the application for your trigger?
Warehouse.
That's interference.
You will have to be inside the IR ring, or forget it.
Unless you start from scratch, go to a new system.
No, I can't do that.
Not enough time.
Too much interference.
You would have to detonate inside.
You lost a wife and a daughter.
But don't forget.
I lost a niece and her little one.
I don't want to lose you, too.
Now you know everything.
No. No, I don't.

So, what you said on the phone.
Is that your plan?
To get everybody into this warehouse?
Yes.
Alphonse is always there.
I just need to get the Albanians there, too.
There are many men.
But your bombs doesn't work.
They work.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another is that you don't care if you get out of there.
You'd rather die than fail.
I'll be around long enough to do what you asked me to do.
I don't want you to do that.
Bring me food.
My mom likes to cook.
It would just go to waste otherwise.
I'll wedge it in between the mustard and those plastic explosives.
You may not care if you get out alive, but in the meantime, you should eat.
My rabbit's foot.
If you don't believe in it, I'll take it back.
Bye.

(SCANNER BEEPS)
Ilir.
(SPEAKING ALBANIAN)
Where did you get this?
A delivery came.
Same bogus return address again.
They have your brother.
There's a little girl.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
TERRY ON PHONE:
Hello?
Hey, it's Fonz.
Listen.
I found this lawyer.
He says he can close the financing on those uptown buildings.
And he don't know anything about Lon pulling out.
Is this guy clean?
Yeah.
He wants to see the Commerce Building.
So I'm gonna meet him there tonight at 9:00.
I don't know, man.
What if our problem shows up?
Pulls some fucking "I don't know" kind of shit.
No, you're the only one that knows.
I gotta go.
(DOORBELL BUZZES)
Yeah.
Yo, Vic.
You with anybody?
Yeah.
I'm busy.
Well, drop your dick.
I found the gypsy cab.
The guy at the cab company says he remembers Paul.
Paul was there.
(LAUGHING) I'm like a detective, man.
Like Columbo.
I'm scaring myself.
Vic?
Right.
I'll be right down.
DARCY:
Hey, Vic.
Vic.
This girl you're seeing.
She your girlfriend?
No. No, it ain't serious.
She's got...
Her face.
Yeah.
Car accident.
Did it affect her?
You have no idea.
Hey, you never mentioned her before.
You embarrassed about me?
Yeah, I'm embarrassed about you.
You're embarrassed about your friends?
Huh?
Fuck you talking about?
So.
This is it right here.
Huh?
The cab dropped off Paul right here.
You're sure?
Yeah.
They keep a track, drop offs, pick-ups.
All right, detective?
Can we leave now?
A cemetery?
That's creepy.
The office is closed tomorrow.
But I could call them.
Maybe I'll come by with a picture of Paul.
See if anybody knows anything.
All right.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Fuck.
Come on.
I gotta get out of here.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
I just got some business to take care of.
Come on in.
So what did you tell Darcy?
Your text said not to tell anyone I was coming.
I told him I was...
Had something to do.
Here's your food.
I set a trap, Victor.
I said whoever walks through that door at 9:00 was going to have a real bad night.
The person doing this to me, he's hurt.
Someone who lost someone.
Like the people in the picture.
And he's in a great deal of pain because of that.
And it's a pain that I've caused.
Then he kills Paul.
And found he was in both feet.
Victor, I want him to know something.
I want him to know that if there's anything left in this world that he still cares about, I'm going to find it.
And I'm gonna burn it down.
He's probably wondering right now what I'm thinking.
What my plan is.
And how much I know.
Wouldn't you be wondering what I'm thinking?
I would.
You know, you're the only one I can trust, Victor.
You know why?
No.
Because you saved my life at Harry's.
It would be something, though.
If you saved my life only to be the one who kills me.
Have a seat.
I must stand, please.
Shh.
They're outside.
(SOBBING)
The other day...
You told me that if I helped you...
Yes!
Believe what I say, my friend.
I don't know, my boss...
He will not know.
You guarantee that?
That I won't be harmed?
I swear to God.
Please.
You're asking me these things, so I know you've been thinking about it.
About me in here.
All right.
Listen to me.
You're in the city.
All right?
You're in the basement of my boss's warehouse.
His name is Alphonse.
Alphonse Hoyt.
I don't know what your brother or his men did to him, but they're gonna kill you whether he pays or not.
(SOBBING)
I got a camera.
You can record a message for your brother.
I'll make sure he gets it.
We gotta go fast.
Tell him where you are.
It's important you tell him where you are.
I swear to you.
Speak.
(SPEAKING ALBANIAN)
Ilir, Ilir, listen...
I'm alive, brother.
I don't know for how much longer.
They're going to kill me.
Even if you pay them the money, they're going to kill me.
They're holding me in a warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt.
I beg you.
I beg you, brother, come quickly.
A warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt...
Alphonse Hoyt!
(SOBBING)
Thank you.
Thank you.
I promise you.
We killed you.
We killed you all!
We killed you all!
I swear on their graves, you didn't.
I swear!
I swear on their graves, you didn't!
(RATS SQUEAKING)
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
Don't let me die like this!
Please!
Please!
Don't let me die!
(SCREAMS)
Please have mercy!
Please!
Don't let me die like this!
Please!
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Yeah.
Yo, I tracked down the manager.
What manager?
From the boneyard.
I thought it was closed today.
He's gonna be here in 15.
Says he needs to feed some fish or some shit.
I can meet him alone, if you're busy.
No, no, I'll be there.
All right.
All right.
Fuck!
I need to send this package.
But I gotta take care of something I didn't count on, so can you send it for me?
Yeah.
What is it?
You don't need to know what it is.
I need to know what it is.
What is it?
It's a video.
It's one of the Albanians saying something I need him to say to the person I need him to say it to.
All right?
Okay.)'-
You need to get a tracking number.
With alerts to my cell phone.
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks.
Wait.
Tell your mother it was very good.
Yeah?
Not too salty?
No.
It was perfect.
Hey, this shit's coming together.
(PICKUP TRUCK DOOR CLOSES)
Paul was definitely here.
How'd you know he was here?
The manager.
He asked for this.
It's a list of all the people buried here.
The guy said he was more interested in the Hungarian section.
The Hungarian section.
Did he say why?
No.
There's hundreds of them.
Ah.
What happened to that girl?
That girl you told me about across the way from you.
You ever meet her?
Yeah.
I met her.
And?
You didn't die two years ago.
They found the cemetery.
They're getting close.
(THUNDER CRASHES)
(GROANS)
The one who found you before got lucky.
And just because he found the grave doesn't mean that they will figure it out as well.
You can walk away, still.
Not too late.
I know why you've been waiting so long.
Why you haven't killed him.
I think you're afraid that when it's over, it won't mend your heart.
(LIFE IN MONO PLAYING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(EXCLAIMS)
You're beautiful.
It was going to waste.
I just felt like putting it on.
I know why you put it on.
Or should I say, ...for whom.
Hey, monster!
Hey!
Get out of here!
Come on!
(EXCLAIMS IN UPSET)
What...
What happened?
I fell and ruined a nice dress.
Let me see.
You Okay?
Yeah.
At least it wasn't my good side.
I sent your package.
I have your tracking number.
Thank you.
Hello, Victor.
Hello.
Go take off your dress, it's covered in blood.
He shouldn't see you like this.
Thank you for returning my Tupperware.
Of course.
People usually don't.
Like it comes with the food.
Free Tupperware.
(LAUGHS)
Did you like the food?
Yeah.
The food was...
It was very good.
Beatrice didn't tell you?
She was nervous you wouldn't like her cooking.
I always told her the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
One of the ways.
She'll keep you well fed.
That's for sure.
You know, this thing, me falling and hitting my head?
Maybe it happened because I lost my rabbit's foot.
The truth is my mom gave it to me after the accident.
She said it was going to bring me luck with my procedures.
I picked the color.
Stupid chartreuse.
(ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING)
Hey-
Would you go out with me tonight?
Somewhere.
Anywhere.
Yeah.
Okay.
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)
Yeah.
DARCY:
Laszlo Kerik.
Laszlo Kerik?
You know the name?
No. No, I don't know him.
I didn't think you would.
I've been searching every dead Hungarian on this cemetery list.
This shit went down about nine months before we were on the crew.
There was a case involving Alphonse and a little girl who was killed in one of his buildings.
The case never went to trial.
Get this, right?
The little girl's mommy and daddy, they died, like, two months afterwards.
They're buried right there next to her.
Vic?
You there?
Vic?
Vic?
Yeah.
I'm here.
I did it, man.
I fucking did it.
I found out exactly what Paul must have found out.
Look, I want to tell Alphonse.
I want you to be there when I tell him.
Can you get there?
No, I'm in the middle of something.
I'll talk to you later.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Oh, Victor.
I didn't know you were coming.
I would have thrown something on.
Maman, you knew very well he was coming.
No, you didn't tell me anything.
Well, I told you so.
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.
So...
Where are we going?
You'll see.
A club?
Very cold.
(LAUGHS)
A park?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Good.
This is...
The bar.
In his house, some credit card receipts.
He usually leaves the bar at 8:30 every night.
But he took a trip.
I want to make sure he's back.
If he's here tonight, he'll probably be here tomorrow night.
I'm prepared to do it then.
I...
I've found a moment with you.
I want to hang onto it.
It's not gonna end up that way.
I never said it would.
Not with words.
I wore that white dress for you.
Was that a mistake?
Yes.
All right, wait here.
I'll be back in a minute.
(PANTING)
What did you do?
It's done.
It's done.
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
One, two.
Nope.
Uh-uh.
Hold up. It's this one.
So you're saying it's someone who knew them?
He must have.
'Cause this guy's dead, right?
Right?
(MUTTERING)
What is it?
The little girl died June 17th.
Two years ago.
Right?
Yeah.
June 17th is tomorrow.
Beatrice.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
Beatrice!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What?
Yeah, I'm walking back to him now. Okay.
Yeah.
ALPHONSE:
Hey, you know who this is, right?
Yeah, I know who it is.
I've been getting these weird letters for the last three months.
With pictures?
With the eyes crossed out?
I've been getting them, too.
Whoever is doing it took my brother.
You remember this problem I had you take care of for me?
Hungarian Rhapsody?
You stayed to the finale.
Right?
Yeah.
And the whole family took a bow?
Yeah.
And you're sure you saw the father take a bow?
DARCY ON PHONE: Where the fuck have you been? I've been trying to call you.
My car won't start.
Some shit's going down, man.
The fucking thing won't start.
What am I going to tell you?
Come pick me up.
What?
(SPEAKING ALBANIAN)
Bring every fucking gun we have.
Ilir...
Brozi?
Here?
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
(ALARM BEEPS)
(GASPS)
(SOBBING)
DARCY: Vic?
You didn't mail the package.
You didn't kill him.
You didn't kill him because you feel something for me.
You knew how I would feel.
You didn't mail the package.
I tried.
And the guy walked away, and I called him back.
I called him back, because I feel something for you.
I could love you.
I don't want you to die.
So I thought that if I could just mess up one of your things, just one thing, it would be enough so it wouldn't work out the way you planned.
So I put my rabbit's foot in that package.
And I took the video card out.
They got my rabbit's foot instead.
We can run away.
They'd find us.
We keep on running.
We travel by night.
I don't care how far we have to go.
Vic?
Shithole.
Holy shit.
(GIGGLING)
Where are you going?
You come back here!
Your father is speaking to you.
(ALL SPEAKING HUNGARIAN ON VIDEO)
Laszlo.
Fucking Laszlo.
I'm gonna wait for you here.
Where are you?
I'm outside your apartment.
Come back.
Please.
Beatrice, I want you to go to your apartment now.
Go there now, and stay there and wait for me.
Okay?
Come here!
If you fucking scream, it will go bang.
Okay?
Okay.
Laszlo fucking Kerik.
You made me a douche, Laszlo Kerik.
I've seen your artwork.
I've seen your fucking pictures.
You put Paul in the freezer.
This has nothing to do with you.
I sent you to my apartment to save you.
All right?
You weren't supposed to go inside.
Yeah, but I did go inside.
I was worried about you.
I don't want to fucking kill you.
Take this opportunity, and you let her go.
You lied to me.
You fucking lied to me.
The godfather of my son.
Let her go.
Let her go.
You listen to me.
You get in your shitty car that does start.
You start your shitty car.
And you drive your shitty car to Alphonse's.
We'll be waiting.
Fuck.
Get up!
What does it mean?

Darcy's here with the girl.

No.
I didn't kill you because they've got you.
(FRENCH POP SONG PLAYING)
(FREAK PLAYING)
Sweetheart.
Go over to the window right now and open it as wide as you can.
Please let me sleep.
I think your mother's here from Mexico, and she needs to leave.
Open the window now.
Why don't you open it, you lazy...
Somebody help!
Close your mouth!
No way.
Can I ride him?
A deer!
Okay.
Daddy, I left the front door open in case any animals wanted to come in.
- You did, huh?
- And one did.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, one crazy-ass one.
No, you did a nice thing, sweetheart.
Greg, I'm gonna need a bat!
- Daddy, no!
- No, no, I'm not going to hit the deer.
I'm just going to massage his head for a little bit with it.
Okay, come on, come on.
He's right here.
He's eating Bowser's food.
Okay, he knows we're here now.
Stay.
Stay.
What's he looking at?
Move your doll towards me.
And back to you.
Towards me.
Back to you.
Three times, fast.
Give me that thing.
- Mr. Gigglesworth?
- No, don't worry.
Give it to me.
- Go on.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Put it in my hand.
Roxanne, take them in there.
Over there.
Hey, dude.
You like this guy?
You want to play with him?
All right, let's go play in the other room.
Come on.
Come on, man.
Slowly walk with me.
I said slowly.
No.
Get out of the way!
Oh, my God!
Problem solved.
Mr. Gigglesworth!
Daddy, he's killing him!
A new problem begins.
I'm sorry.
Is that your bra, Mrs. Feder?
Easy.
It is nice.
- Thank you, all right.
- Cool, yeah.
Yeah, come on.
28?
Yes.
35.
That's right again, smarty-pants.
Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Bean, working on the math, huh?
- Yep.
Mommy said if I get all my math questions right,
I get to ride my bike to school with Becky Feder.
Really?
Okay, Bean, well, what's seven plus nine?
Seventy-nine.
Is he a little boy or a computer?
'Cause I can't figure it out.
Don't destroy his confidence.
Happy summer, everybody.
Okay, you sure you want to go with those boots, honey?
I know you bedazzled them yourself.
I'm just wondering if they'll attract too much attention, you know, from outer space.
It's the last day of school, and Mom says I'm free to express myself.
Building the confidence right here with R2-D2.
Confidence.
K-O-B-R-Q-V-Y.
Confidence.
Well, we're not gonna have to pay for college.
That's for sure.
Looks like a horse took a dump in Ronnie's diaper.
You're gonna need federal aid to clean that up.
Ronnie, honey, did a doo-doo grenade go off in your diaper?
- You gonna change it?
- That's not my son, that's your son.
Yesterday was my diaper day.
Today he is all yours, and it's gonna get nasty.
Go, Ronnie.
- Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.
- Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.
He looks like Nicki Minaj trying to shake her butt implants back into place.
- Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.
- Come on, Ronnie.
Go, Ronnie.
You got a lot of appointments today, sweetie?
Nah, just one repairjob.
Very special.
All right, I'm going in.
What is...
What is this?
A necklace?
Happy 20th anniversary, babe.
Wow, Dad, you remembered.
Yeah.
Mom didn't.
That's cold.
I think I'm gonna bust out of here.
So he gets off the train and nobody's there?
Braden needs to spend at least one summer with you so he can say he has a dad, you deadbeat, Higgins.
Well, not to be mean, but I'm not even 1,000% sure who you are.
I was up from Florida.
Right in the middle of making out, I got a really bad case of the hiccups.
Hiccups McGee?
Oh, my God, I have a kid I don't know about with Hiccups McGee?
And no offense, but I'm gonna have to ask for a DNA test, you know, because you just never...
No need.
Later, Hiccups.
You're him.
Yeah, without the hat.
It's actually a good likeness.
How you doing, man?
I'm your dad.
Nice to see you, Braden.
That's strike one.
Good news is, you get...
Unlimited amount of strikes.
How about I take you to school?
No school.
Summertime.
Not yet.
One more day.
I know, it's a drag.
Normally I'd let you just blow it off and play hooky, but I'm volunteering at the soup kitchen today, so when I'm done,
I'll come pick you up and we'll hang out.
I got you this, but...
Obviously you're, like, 13, so I don't know, but it's actually pretty nice and cute, and you should cut the head off it, okay.
Well, let's get going.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, don't forget this.
- Is it a gift?
No, it's the Gigglesworth massacre.
I told Becky you could sew it back together for her.
What?
Martha Stewart couldn't fix this.
Come on.
But you're such a good daddy for picking up all the pieces.
That's why I've been thinking, we moved back here to your hometown so we could have more quality time with our family, right?
That's right.
How would you feel about expanding?
- Having another kid?
- Yeah.
But it's perfect right now, you know?
If I buy one large pizza, Greg gets two pieces,
Keith gets two, Becky gets one, you get one, I get four.
It's kind of perfect, you know.
I don't want to have to buy another pie.
Why don't you go on a diet, fat gordo éste?
Come on, I've had a job since I'm 16.
It's the first time I've got a free schedule.
I'm just enjoying the fun.
Don't forget Becky's ballet recital at 11:00.
I got to go to that?
I mean, I get to go to that?
Great.
I'm saying, that's...
I thought it was sold out.
That's great news.
Have the best last day of school, my gorgeous children!
I love you all!
- Bye, Mom, bye.
- Bye, Mom.
Yeah, last day of school, Greg.
Last chance to ask out Nancy Arbuckle.
Nancy Arbuckle...
What's that?
You like a girl?
Is that why you've been taking them long showers?
No, I'm conditioning my hair.
That's all I do in the shower...
Condition my hair.
That's not what the deer told me.
That deer's a liar.
I heard too much conditioning can make you go blind.
What?
Where'd you hear that?
- Higgins.
- I should kill him.
He's too chicken to ask her out, Dad, 'cause she's the hottest girl in school, and Greg is fugly.
So what he's fugly?
All the guys in our family are fugly.
That don't stop us from getting the hot chicks.
Look at me and look at your mother.
I mean, it makes no sense.
Only in, like, a Hollywood movie or something.
Every guy in school likes her, Dad.
And you'll be the guy who ends up with her.
You know why?
You're gonna follow my three-step program.
Number one, make the girl smile.
Number two, tell her she has a nice smile.
Number three, say she has to go out with you that night.
Why that night?
'Cause it gives her less time to think about how fugly you are.
'Cause you are fugly.
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
And Keithie's right...
I'm too chicken to even talk to her.
Hey, you're a Feder.
Feders ain't afraid of women, buddy.
That's not the way I'm raising you.
By the way, Dad, did you ask Mom if I can play football?
No, I was scared.
I'm afraid she's gonna yell at me in that accent that no one understands.
Come on, Becky, it's 8:00.
School starts at 8:15.
That means we only have 25 minutes.
Daddy, you promise Mr. Gigglesworth will be better by bedtime?
Will you stop worrying about him?
He'll be fine. I love you.
- Have the best last day, okay?
- Okay.
'Bye,guys.
-Bye, Daddy.
- Love you.
- And you read the street signs, okay?
Don't let Bean.
My God, riding their bikes to school.
Couldn't do that in L.A. with the nuts out there.
Yeah, 'cause thank God there's no crazy people out here.
How you doing, Nick?
My wife's leaving me after three weeks.
Three weeks?
That's not bad for you.
What happened?
She found me eating a banana with my butt.
And she didn't like that?
Yeah, she got really bummed out, but, you know, I shouldn't have done it at her mom's house.
Yeah, you...
You seem like you're a little extra out of it today.
What's going on?
Yeah, I'm a little medicated.
I met a very reliable doctor at a Cypress Hill concert, and he floated me a couple pills just to feel better, you know.
But I don't feel better!
You feel worse!
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your new bus driver.
Finally got yourself a job.
Actually I'm filling in for Drool-io lglesias back there.
Hey, Deanne, happy anniversary.
Thank you, Lenny.
Lenny remembered.
Isn't that sweet?
- And I never got him pregnant.
- She forgot?
- Yeah, she forgot.
- No.
I got the biggest get-out-of-jail-free card in the world.
I want one of those.
You ain't never get one like this.
Hey, honey,
I'm gonna take a ride to work with Lenny.
Don't worry about forgetting the 20th.
I'm sure you'll remember the 30th.
I love you.
Yeah, sure you do...
Deep down.
That's not another necklace in there, is it?
I'm gonna abuse this get-out-of-jail-free card,
I'm telling you right now.
I mean, maybe I'll walk on the good rug without taking off my boots.
Or have a nice non-diet soda with my dinner.
Notjust one, either, a whole damn pitcher.
- So you're going full gangsta.
- Yeah.
But you know what I'd really like to do?
Throw a "first night of summer" party.
- Yeah.
- You know, something a little crazy.
Well, it's been many, many years since we've done something crazy.
Just one problem, though.
My house isn't big enough.
But yours is.
Last party I had was senior year in high school.
Yeah, that was, like, the best night of my life.
We all hooked up with chicks.
Come on, why not do that again?
Because we already have chicks and kids and high cholesterol now, sojust...
It's time to move on.
You want to come over tonight with Dee, that's fine...
I think.
I got to ask my wife first.
Okay, gangsta.
Hey, hey, where'd you get those shoes, Losers "R" Us?
I made them.
You made them?
In a toilet?
That kid's like White Precious.
Get lost, Duffy.
Yeah, leave her alone.
Hey, what'd you say, Hollywood?
- You got something to say to me?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Attention, Kmart shoppers, let's find a seat, please.
Yes, you in the camouflage jacket and Mariah Carey hairdo.
Yeah, just pop a squat, thank you.
You're lucky your dad's here, but he won't be here all day.
Leave me alone.
Beanbag with arms and legs, seriously, take a seat, or seats, before someone gets hurt.
You're dead, man.
I'm gonna go get some things done, and then I'm gonna go to my daughter's ballet recital, so you're on your own until lunchtime.
No worries.
No one will come in anyway.
Right.
Does Leonard ever talk about me?
Leonard?
Your husband.
Lenny.
I probably should have told you this before I started working here, but he used to be my boyfriend.
When did you guys go out?
Sixth grade.
This one time, we split a piece of bubble gum at recess.
I brought in a note that he sent me, and I thought you should see it.
I just felt weird having a secret with you.
"Do you like my hair better in a barrette or a headband?"
That's what I wrote.
"Barrette."
And that was his response.
Does it bother you that I still wear it?
No, no, no, I think it's sweet.
I think he still has feelings for me.
I'm gonna go work out now.
Do you really think that a tight, toned body will keep him away from his Hubba Bubba baby?
I hope so. Bye.
You just messed with the wrong girl, chica!
They spray-painted my baby.
Gee, and everything's spelled right.
These can't be my students.
Have a nice day, Rapunzel.
Hey, guys, can you believe this?
Calendar turns to June, my wonderful students, they become animals.
Maybe they're just mad that you keep going to the babyGap to buy your clothes.
Hey, Principal Tardio, good morning.
Right to class, right to class.
How was your last ride in before the summer, Nick?
Remember, today is only a half a day.
- And a half a shirt, right?
- What?
- I said he wants to wave good-bye to you.
- Okay.
- Here he goes.
- I'm excited about the summer, too.
Hey, that's my laptop!
That's not waterproof!
- Monkey boy, monkey boy.
- Summer!
- Monkey boy.
- Summer!
Summer!
Summer!
So, what do you think?
Do I take you straight to work?
I got one appointment I got to get to sometime between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
- Okay.
- But she can wait.
Good.
And look at this.
He's back at it again.
Why isn't he at work?
He's just...
This woman has a grip on him.
It's ridiculous.
It's gonna ruin his marriage.
Thank you for breakfast, Mommy.
Will you be coming by to watch Days of Our Lives later?
Well, we got to find out which twin murdered Renaldo, right?
We sure do.
- Okay.
- Hey, Mrs. Lamonsoff, good to see you.
Nice school bus, Lenny.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
Did Mommy make the boo-boo go away?
Don't tell the wife.
What are you guys doing?
Get in.
Oh, hey, Nick.
Nice.
Nice.
Let's hit it.
Watch this.
- Wow.
- You got to respect that.
That was awesome.
What's Lenny's problem?
They're so cute when they're little.
I know.
I miss it.
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
You miss that?
Really?
Stay.
Stay.
Don't you growl at me.
Stay, baby, Stay-
Excuse me.
Is your kid gonna be in here when the instructor comes in?
That's not my kid.
That's my lover, and he's very gentle.
Kids don't belong in here.
That leash better not trip me up.
Leash isn't gonna trip you up.
It's your big-ass, hairy man feet that are gonna trip you up.
She was just joking around, sir.
Cool it.
You're gonna get us killed.
I'm sorry.
I'm having the worst day.
Welcome to Squat Fitness, ladies.
Apparently your new instructor's running a bit late.
I'm sorry.
It's only five till...
Yeah, so he asked me to lead you in some warm-up exercises.
So, everybody, up on your feet, and let's take a deep breath.
Good.
Deeper...
Really stretch out those lungs.
And now let's shimmy.
Shake the shoulders back and forth.
Shake them.
Very 900d, very good.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Now let's do some jackhammer squats.
Right, put your hands in front of you like this.
Just relax.
And then squat up and down but fast.
Faster, faster, there you go.
Really fast.
Faster, faster.
Too fast.
Do it a little slower.
Now, everybody turn, face the back of the room, bend over, and reach for your toes.
Why do we have to turn around?
If you please.
And bend over as low as you can go.
Now take the right hand and slap it against the right cheek.
Relax the wrist and slap that right butt, slap it.
Good, I want to hear that slap.
Yes, this is wonderful.
Morning, ladies.
You started without me?
Yes, just like you asked me to.
Say it's true even if it isn't.
What?
You loved it!
You loved it!
Yeah, that's my boy.
- All right.
- You're all prostitutes!
Anyway.
I'm Kyle, and welcome to the summer session of Squatrobics 101.
I wish they called it something else, but that's what they told me to say.
Okay, so, before we start for real, any questions?
Yes.
Are you married?
No.
Nope, I'm...
I'm single.
Yeah.
I forgot.
You're so gorgeous, my head is spinning.
I'm sorry.
God.
Go ahead.
I have a very important question, and it's a two-parter.
The first part of the question is, "Did a scientist make you in a lab?"
And the second part of the question is,
"Can I stick my tongue down your throat, please?"
All right, guys, look, I'm flattered.
Really, I am, but most of you are married and I happen to be gay.
Of course he is.
- All of 'em.
- That sucks!
What a waste!
Stay out of my bag, little man.
Why does she have this?
That's not a jock strap, that's a G-string.
Well, well, well, if it isn't Hollywood and the Squares.
Hey, Malcolm, I didn't know you worked at Kmart, and apparently the hair on top of your head didn't know it, either.
What?
Do me a favor, go like this.
I think I got something in my teeth.
- What?
- You know, next time, you should use that Chia Pet stuff on your whole head.
What?
Why is Higgins buying
O.J.'s knife right now?
- You think you're tough?
- Hey, Malcolm, is that the knife the Indians used to half-scalp you with?
I don't even get that.
What?
Come on, let's cheer him up
Benny Hill-style.
Here we go.
Come On, come On, come On, come On...
Does that make you feel better?
Yo, Crocodile Dumb-dee, how'd it go with the kid?
Good, good.
He's in school.
Kid's in school for one day?
I didn't know what else to do.
He's a thug, Lenny.
He cut the head off a teddy bear.
Imagine what he'll do to me.
So you're gonna buy this to cut his head off?
No, I just want him to think I'll cut his head off so then he won't cut my head off.
You want to scare a relative without causing permanent injury?
May I Suggest this?
Sir?
Sir?
Can you get off the bed?
It's wake-up time.
Yeah, all right, Grandma, I'm up!
Stop yelling at me.
Now, why is...
Being mean?
I like sleeping over.
It's just you always yell.
You don't have to yell at me.
I love you.
I don't understand.
Clean-up, aisle nine.
Get out of me!
And bring a shovel.
So, my son Bumpty told me he's gonna ask your daughter out on a date at school today.
First of all, my daughter's never been out on a date before, and I'm sure she's not gonna start off with some kid named Bumpty.
He is the only other black kid in her grade.
Wait, you want her to date a white guy?
Yeah, Farrakhan.
I'd rather she date the whitest white guy in the world than your little bald-headed boy.
All right, but, you know, don't worry when she says yes, 'cause I already had the talk with him.
- What talk?
- Dating.
I told him how we used to roll with the ladies in high school.
You know, beep-beep.
What?
I should get some pepper spray for my kid.
Some moron on the bus keeps messing with him, and he refuses to fight back.
You know, that reminds me of someone I know.
- Who?
- You.
What are you talking about?
I got in plenty of fights.
Remember ninth grade when Tommy Cavanaugh moved here from Texas?
He nonstop abused you, and you did nothing about it.
Tommy Cavanaugh was a 'row freak.
He had back zits on his back zits.
Plus, he was joking around with me.
If it was real, I swear to God, I would've knocked him out.
Hey, isn't that Cavanaugh right there?
Where?
Gotcha.
That was really funny, man, really funny.
Hey, you weren't exactly Captain Courageous when we were growing up, now, were you?
Hey, I never backed out of a fight, though.
Yeah, but did you everjump off Suicide 35 at the quarry?
That's right.
He always came up with a lame excuse not to do it.
- What are you talking about?
-"I can't.
"I'm on my period.
It'll attract sharks."
Suicide 35 off the top rock.
35 feet above the water.
My mom did thatjump when she was pregnant with me.
There's a raft in there?
Who did that?
All right, little birds.
Find your nests, man.
Float down.
There we go, and we're in.
All right, guys, normally we don't have exciting news this late into the term, but we have a new student joining us today, Braden Higgins.
Hey, there's an empty seat over there, man.
Why don't you go cop a squat?
Or go that way, man.
Take your own path.
No.
I sit here.
Is your dad Marcus Higgins?
Yeah, I've known him since I was a baby.
He's the funniest.
The best.
Great, great man.
I want to smash his face.
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah, I hate that guy.
Screw him.
Yo, Charlotte, hold up, hold up.
Question...
How would you like to spend the first night of summer with a hardcore up-and-comer?
What does that mean?
I think he's asking you out.
He is?
You are?
I don't make stuff up.
Well, can Donna come?
Three's a crowd, McCloud.
No, he didn't.
Yes, he did.
It's okay, Charlotte.
It's a date, your first date.
Just you two.
All right.
I mean,
I'd have to ask my parents, but I think that would be okay.
Hey, Bumpty.
You think just because it's the last day of school, you can sit and socialize the entire period?
I don't think about stuff like that, Lady Shorts.
Well, can you think fast?
Who wants to watch me climb a rope?
Yeah!
You're the man!
Yo, he's got to put those Easter eggs back in the basket.
Dang!
Kelly, I don't want to hear it!
I can't take it anymore!
I wish I never had you!
Stop it!
Stop it!
See, that's why I don't want four kids.
- Yeah, people with fourjust lose their minds.
- Yeah.
They're yelling, they're screaming.
Sometimes they go to jail just to get some sleep.
Hold up.
Hang on.
I got a burpsnart coming.
- Come on.
- You got to teach me how you do that.
- A burpsnart?
It's simple.
- Yeah.
You just start with a burp, then you sniff for a sneeze, you get that going, and that triggers a fart, always.
What's up with this school bus?
Okay.
I stole it.
What?
Put your hands in the air.
And wave them like you just don't care "ho"
"ho"
I heard you're having a party tonight, Lenny.
What?
I'm not having a party.
Where did you hear that?
He's a cop.
He hears everything.
Oh, God.
Look, it's Magnum P.U.
Look at him getting all serious.
I still can't believe you're a cop after all the sick stuff you did growing up.
The Peter Dante who stole your parents' snowmobile and sold it to purchase crack cocaine is dead, Feder.
This side of the law is way better.
To serve and protect.
Got to love it.
Hey, McKenzie, I heard you assaulted somebody in there.
I didn't assault anybody.
I just choked out your brother.
Yeah, he deserves it.
He's crazy.
We got five minutes to get to that stupid recital.
Recital?
- At McDonough Elementary?
- Yes.
- Can I come?
- Why?
Trust me.
Everybody's got to go.
We got five minutes.
We're never gonna make it there.
You'll get there on time, 'cause we're gonna give you a four-alarm presidential police escort.
Isn't that against the law?
I am the law!
What's happening?
Oh, my God!
Whatjust happened?
Welcome, parents, to final performance of school year, our June-a-licious
Dance Spectacular!
Now, for this year, we go throwing a few hip-hop moves in there.
Like this.
Is fun to dance.
Let the show begin.
So nice of you to invite your friends and the bus driver and the police force to our daughter's dance recital.
Yeah, huge ballet fans, all of them.
She's so cute.
- So cute.
- She's adorable, isn't she?
She is adorable.
- Fantastic stuff.
- Unbelievable.
- Look at her go.
- I am.
I'm looking at her.
I want to arrest her for disturbing the peace.
In my pants.
I'm having a wonderful time.
She's got a solo?
What?
It's fine.
I just wish that you would give me more than eight hours notice before you tell me that we're throwing a party, babe.
It's not a party.
Get out of here.
- It's a couple people coming by.
- Come on.
How'd you like it?
- You were great, honey.
- Hey!
Where did you learn to dance like that?
She moves like "Yagger," no?
Yes, she does, she moves like...
Mick Yagger?
Is that what you were saying?
Hey, butter buns, you ready to grab some eats?
Yes.
Cavanaugh.
Lenny Feder, I'll be damned.
Honey, this is Tommy Cavanaugh.
He was my old steroid that I grew up with.
This is my...
Wife, Roxanne.
Why are your hands shaking, Daddy?
My hands are shaking?
Probably because I had too much coffee this morning, sweetheart.
I heard you been running around saying you could take me in a fight.
You...
I wouldn't say that.
Yeah, you did, this morning in Kmart.
Kmart?
Was I there?
- I don't think I was there.
- You know, all I can remember about this guy is smacking him around whenever I wanted to, and him not doing a single thing about it.
Yeah, we had a lot of good times like that growing up.
Why is your voice so shaky, Daddy?
Are you crying?
You don't stop talking, do you?
Honey, we should be getting going.
Sure, baby.
I want you to stop making up lies about kicking my ass or I'm gonna have to set you straight.
Sure, sure, sure.
I'll see you around.
Becky, you be having great summer.
I was one inch away from knocking that guy out, and I swear to God.
No, you weren't.
This is grown-up talk, so butt out!
That's insane!
What did you say to him?
I said, "Hey, Cavanaugh, you speak to me like that again
"in front of my wife and kid, I will brush your teeth with a brick."
No, you didn't. You just yelled at me.
- I don't yell at you!
- Calm down.
No, I'm just saying.
You guys were in the bathroom.
Look who's here, everybody.
20 VOSS waters, right?
- That's how they do it in Hollyweird.
- I don't know.
We haven't lived there in, what, 10 months now or something?
As a matter of fact, our son starts work here tonight.
I know.
I heard you brown-nosed Mr. Pappas and now Showbiz Junior's got a job.
I used to scoop cones here, and why shouldn't he?
It's a great first job for a kid.
Or lifetime job.
Okay, what are we having?
Becky, what do you want, hon?
Can I have the soft chocolate cup, please?
Here's a word you probably never heard, no.
The machine's busted, princess.
Bummer, it's broken?
Like all your dreams?
You know what, it's easy to fix.
I can help you with that.
What do you know about fixing ice cream machines, Higgins?
I went to DeVry for a year.
- That's right.
- I can fix anything with a plug.
Including your hair?
That's not true.
I don't even know how that got started.
That's, like, people are saying that around town.
I'll walk you through it.
You just walk up, climb up the machine, lean over the back.
Can't believe I'm listening to this idiot.
Listen to the man.
You're gonna see two pipes coming into the top.
- Yes!
- In between them, there's gonna be a silver button.
Hit it a little bit.
Push hard.
No. Hit it with your fist.
Yeah, just push the button.
- I got it.
- There we go!
I think we're getting somewhere.
Okay, keep going.
Yeah, that...
Force it.
That's it.
Hey!
Why is Dickie crapping all over the ice cream stand?
What'd she say?
- Nothing!
Nothing!
- Go! Just go!
Go, Dickie!
That's where ice cream comes from?
And so we've reached the end of another school year.
F root Loop'?
Ten months of learning, growth and, yes, hopefully, a little bit of fun.
But the journey we began together, in September, does not end today.
For education is a process that does not begin and end on some set schedule...
Please let me finish.
Return to your seats.
Damn you!
Every year, you do this to me!
And this was my favorite shirt from when I was 12!
How you doing, sophomore?
Not bad, sophomore.
Come here!
Hey, you're not a statue.
You' re an ass-me.
Doesn't even make any sense.
Shut up!
What?
What?
What?
Nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
What's up, man?
Your dad picking you up?
I don't know.
I told him it'd be cool if he stayed late at the soup kitchen, so it's on me.
Well, you can come on the bus with us, if you want.
Nah, how about we do something fun?
How about we do something we're not supposed to?
"Keep out."
Thatjust makes me want to not keep out.
Heard our dads used to come swimming here, back in the day.
They claim to be all squeaky clean, but I think they were nuts.
College kids.
We better go.
No go.
Sta)'-
He's nuts.
Let's go.
Hey!
Where are you guys 90mg?
Join the party.
Here.
One and two.
Are you guys freshmen?
No. We're seniors.
We just became seniors, like, 20 minutes ago.
Not high school seniors, college seniors.
Wait a minute!
I remember you guys.
You're Scully.
You're Boomer.
Come here.
I love you guys so much.
- I love you, too.
- Girl, I love you more.
I'm gonna go.
Body shots!
No go.
Sta)'-
Okay, okay.
But what about these beers, man?
If we don't drink them, they'll be onto us, and I'm not sure I'm ready for beer yet.
Wait, let's just dump them when no one's looking, then act like we're drunk.
Okay.
Good idea.
All right, let's go.
Summertime.
You're sure you want to do this, big man?
No shame in backing down.
- Really?
- Come on!
Come on.
It's a lifelong shame.
You're finally doing Suicide 35.
It's a big day.
What are you scared of, man?
You're the "rope from the tree, triple flip, bird-crush" guy.
I'm not scared of this.
In the past, I did it before.
But I'll do it right now.
Sure.
Sure.
Go ahead.
Do it.
Do it.
But the thing is this, I just...
I ate about 45 minutes ago.
What did you eat?
I had chicken chow mein.
Chicken chow mein?
When did...
We were with you the whole time!
Yeah.
You didn't see it?
They had it at Kmart.
- They have chicken chow...
- Get out of here.
- It's good there.
Yeah. -It's very good.
What do I hear right now?
Look at this.
Beers on ice.
Hot ladies everywhere.
This is how we used to do it.
- This is how I still do it, buddy.
- He does still do it that way.
Well, you should stop.
This is Kappa Eta Sigma property.
So you might want to quit perving on our ladies and get back to your trailer homes.
Okay, easy there, Abercrombie.
I think it's...
I think we've been around a little longer than you.
Been swimming here since we were eight years old, so you can calm down a little bit.
I'm sure it was the bomb!
Cranking your Al Jolson tunes on your transistor radio.
But it's the 21st century now.
And Thicky-Thick and the Flabby Bunch should never take their shirts off again.
- That hurts.
- Okay, I guess I'm Thicky-Thick.
Yeah, well, I don't like being in the Flabby Bunch, either.
Boom!
That just happened.
I haven't been around this many arrogant white college kids since Eminem played Duke.
There it goes.
And then...
Boom!
That just happened.
How was that?
At least we got into college, skinny Danny Glover.
- Long handjob.
- That's Rock, Paper, Scissors.
I think it's over.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What, what, what?
What?
And a little extra right there.
Hey, fellows, that was a good handshake.
We got a good one, too. it goes like this.
- Okay, here we go.
- How you doing, sir?
Nice to see you.
Very good, sir.
- Yeah, at least we're not stuck in some crap town like this, hanging up drywall for the rest of our lives.
Bay-com!
Hanging drywall?
First of all,
I'll have you know that I own pretty much the greatest auto body shop in town, all right?
This guy works for the cable company.
Free cable for life.
What?
Over here, you know Higgins?
That's right, he works part-time down at the go-kart track.
So he was highballing you with the drywall.
Boom!
This just got real.
- Real stupid?
What happened?
- Something's real.
- Yeah...
- Dougie, Dougie...
Are you guys as wasted as us?
Hells, yeah!
All the time!
Yo, we're gonna let you guys continue your Klan meeting in a minute.
He's just gonna jump off of here, and then we'll leave.
I can't permit that.
I can't permit it!
Can't permit it.
You guys have ruined our celebration by being here.
Look at my hands, huh?
They're shaking, I'm so mad.
Yeah, look, my brother's shaking.
- That was a cool move.
- Now, listen to me.
I'm gonna kick this kid's ass.
But I need, like, 11 to 15 minutes to stretch out, okay?
I got to stretch.
It's overlooked.
No, I understand.
I can't fight these kids.
I'm skinny Danny Glover.
Guys, this guy's doing 11 flips behind you for some unknown reason.
We got kids, we can't afford to do this.
Buddy,dude, you don't have to do that last flip.
Don't, like, get hurt.
We'll come back another time.
You will come back never!
This is Kappa Eta Sigma property!
Dude, why are you acting so crazy?
Did Betty White just call you crazy?
- Did he just call you Betty White?
-Betty White?
That's pretty funny.
We've got a situation!
You know what?
Hey, guys? Guys?
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Let's get out of here.
Listen, it's nice to meet everybody.
- We're gonna take off, but let's do this again.
- Take care, guys.
- Enjoy yourself.
- Not that way.
Is there an elevator?
That way.
Come on, are you serious?
You gonna make us jump?
Naked.
Asshole.
You guys are losers.
Don't worry, it gets bigger.
That poor old lady!
Rm Paralyzed!
I'm in so much pain!
Mama!
No!
I was inside you!
I can't believe nobody's even scared of a black guy anymore!
Damn you, Obama!
What the hell just happened?
I saw my dad's dick.
Well, the good news is Lamonsoff finally did the jump for real.
And the bad news is he landed on my face.
What are you, made of rocks, dude?
Check this out, feel this.
I'm not kidding you.
Right up here.
I think even higher.
- Feel that.
- And?
Put your hand right there.
Feel the other one.
Those are my balls.
I'm not kidding you, they went way up in there.
You're getting me turned on.
Are you kidding me?
What?
They slashed our tires!
These kids won't stop abusing us!
Damn you!
This wasn't college kids.
It was my son, Satan.
And why is this kid so angry?
His mom hiccupped a lot, but she was happy!
And hot.
If she's so hot, why don't you make her your late-night booty call?
Beefcakes!
Come on, baby!
You've been sneaking around with Fabio?
It's not funny, dude!
She's gonna kick the crap out of me later!
Wow.
- A little five-hour Energy, huh?
- Yeah.
500-hour Energy?
I drink it for the taste, okay?
Oh, my God, you gonna jog to Florida after this?
No!
A bonus!
Come on, just cram yourself in there.
My body, it's just too big for this thing.
I can't fit.
Higgins, dummy, hop in this thing for a minute.
- For what?
- Just get in the tire.
- No way!
In there?
- Five yards we'll roll you.
We've done it.
I would do it if I could get in there.
This is peer pressure, you're bullying.
And I promise you I'll stop you and I love you.
Don't let him do it.
He's jacked up on juice.
And a-one, and a-two...
- Mommy's got you.
-...and a-three!
- Okay, five feet.
Grab me.
- Y'ello.
- Lenny!
- Hey, Keithie.
Meet me at the football field, but don't tell your mother.
Why am I still rolling?
Lenny!
Help!
Guys, get me!
- Hang in there!
- I'm going downhill!
Lenny!
No!
No!
When will it end?
Yeah.
Summer is here, man!
Help!
Stop!
No!
Tire on the loose!
Fluzoo, shotgun, now!
Someone!
Higgins is in the tire!
Of course.
- Help!
- Get there!
Help!
- Liar!
- No, no, baby!
No!
No!
Someone!
Shaw's over, tire.
I'm next.
- I got next!
- No, I'm next!
It's my tire!
My turn!
Hey!
What happened?
I got a phone call.
Okay.
I forgive you.
Was it long-distance or something?
Don't want to kick a guy while he's down, Higgins, but we caught your son with a can of spray paint looking like he was up to no good.
You lied about the soup.
You lied about the soup!
We are gonna find those fartheads, and we are gonna kill them.
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
No, guys!
Not each other!
We're not killing each other!
K-E-I-T
H-I-E.
Keithie, Keithie, Keithie!
It's a practice, Donna.
You don't have to go full speed.
Sorry, Mr. Feder.
It's fine!
Hey, look at these giant mooses out there.
You don't want to get in the middle of all that.
Plus, the kicker, honestly, is like, one of the most important guys on the team and you don't have to worry about getting your head bashed in every play.
I get it, Dad.
I'm a wimp.
You're not a wimp.
It's just common sense.
Avoid big idiots trying to hurt you.
I was trying to avoid a big idiot trying to hurt me on the bus this morning, but he wouldn't leave me alone.
Well, sometimes they won't let you avoid them, and you just...
You can't back down in those situations.
I'm telling you, I've backed down a few times, it's not a good feeling.
All right, look, let'sjust kick a few field goals.
It's like soccer, which you're great at.
All you got to do is put your foot right through the ball.
What?
Touchdown!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That's ridiculous!
Your first try?
All right, we're backing up, boy.
That was totally awesome, Keithie!
That was so cool!
That was just, like, awesome!
Okay, drive through the ball.
Drive through the ball.
It's up!
Yeah!
Go, Keithie!
Yes!
What did you eat this morning?
All right, this is starting to get into, like, college level.
From the 30!
Who the hell is this kid?
Oh, my God!
Stop!
Keithie time!
I'm starting to think she has a little crush on you.
Really?
Either that or she got bit by a poisonous spider.
Keithie!
All right, let's see how you do in a real game situation, though.
Okay?
Let's pretend I'm a linebacker, and I'm gonna come at you and try and block it.
Okay.
Set!
Hike!
I'm a crazy linebacker!
Give me that football!
My leg!
Keithie!
Don't tell your mother!
All right, that kid's dead. Back to work.
Now, you remember how to do a five-point turn, right?
Yeah.
- Parallel park?
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, don't "yeah, yeah" me, dumb-ass.
You're precious cargo.
Now, if you mess around and get yourself killed,
I'm gonna have to kill you.
Look, Dad, I'm ready for this, all right?
You're late.
Hello, McKenzie.
Hey, Wiley, how you feeling?
Just two years of this.
And I still only have 40% feeling in my body.
Otherwise, I'm fine.
No, Rihanna's fine.
You just teach driver's ed.
Get her done, son!
And remember everything we talked about!
Defensive driving!
Stop at all yellows!
Obey the laws!
- You moron! - Look out!
Be safe!
Don't do what I just did!
Hey, officers, you guys want to stick around and have a drink with me, hang out a little bit?
You're afraid of us leaving you alone with your son, aren't you?
My son...
Are you kidding me?
I don't care...
- Boo!
- He's got a knife!
That sounds dangerous.
How far was the drop?
Just 35 feet.
Who do you think you are, Tarzan?
- It's no big deal.
- Honey?
Hi, Sally.
Hi, honey.
No, I just came to see if Mommy was alive.
And looking now, she's breathing, she's good.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I was bringing your mother a new fan for the summer.
- You said you couldn't get coffee with me because you had a 3:30 appointment with a Mr. Renaldo.
Hello, ladies!
You!
Can't be!
We killed you.
Last week.
You actually think two amateurish nitwits could kill The Great Renaldo?
I told you.
You did.
You called it.
So the leg's not really broken, huh?
No, it is broken, right here.
Just a hairline fracture, though.
No, it's a clean break.
Slight, though.
Slight?
No. It's broken.
Broken-broken or just broken?
It's a broken leg.
What was once one bone is now two half-bones.
Right.
Is there anything you can do about my wife staring at me?
No, I'm not a psychiatrist.
So you're saying my wife is crazy?
No, no.
I was joking.
Like you were when you said his leg is broken.
Look, your son is going to be wearing that cast the entire summer.
If you don't mind, I haven't slept in 68 hours. So you're a little loopy from lack of sleep, and that really isn't my son's bone.
That's a piece of celery you snapped.
' Len ﬂy!
~Yes?
The leg is broken!
You can't undo this, and you lied to me, so you're gonna pay for it.
Doctor, wouldn't it be nice if there was a cure for anger?
There is.
It's called Jack Daniel's.
Another one of your jokes, huh?
I Wish.
Okay, the light is red now, so just remain stopped.
Scully, is that you?
Scully!
Hey, what's up, fellas?
Are you taking your driver's test drunk?
Yeah, I'm MC Hammered!
- You're a madman!
- Psychopath, man!
Hey, Scully, Scully.
Have you seen those old townies from the quarry today?
No, I can't say I did.
Why?
They disrespected our frat house!
Man, they disrespected the crap out of it!
No, can't have that.
Brewski time, dude!
It's not for you, Scully.
It's for that freak in the hat next to you.
Looks like he needs it.
- Boom!
- Yeah!
That just happened!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Taking your driver's test while intoxicated?
Minus five points.
This is ridiculous!
I've wasted an entire day waiting for this idiot to show up.
Did you tell him your son-in-law works for the cable company?
A fat lot of good being related to that bozo would do me.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
Love to the children.
Yes.
Yes.
Damn it, I just sat down.
I'll be right out there!
Hang on!
I'm coming as quick as I can.
I got bunions, damn it!
No!
No!
You burn in hell!
You cable-installing mother...
Damn it!
Look, man,
I know deadbeat dads always have lame excuses why they don't see their kids, but "I didn't know you existed till about a week ago"
is actually a fantastic excuse.
So can you cut me some slack?
Her name's not Hiccups McGee.
Yeah, I know that.
So why do you call her that?
No, that's just...
It's stupid.
It's just kind of a nickname I give people that, you know, have a distinct trait or physical feature.
Like, if someone had big lips, you'd call them Lippy McGee.
And if they sneezed a lot, you'd call them Sneezy McGee.
So you'd be Ugly McGee.
I'd be Ugly McGee.
Exactly.
Shorty McGee.
Shorty McGee, sure.
Viagra McGee.
Right, right.
You get it, you get it.
Listen, man,
I'm willing to give this a try if you are.
You know what they say...
Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery.
Maybe we go inside and search the Internet for funny videos of squirrels waterskiing.
Okay, we're getting somewhere.
I'm sorry I lied about the appointment.
The lying's not the worst part.
You hid from me at your mother's house, Eric.
Who does that?
Look, she's nice to me.
You know, she always takes my side, worries if I'm eating enough and taking my vitamins.
I do all that stuff, too, Eric.
Okay, I don't.
You're right.
You know, there's only so many hours in a day, and I'm always running around the kids, and I guess I leave you out a lot, and I'm really gonna try harder to make you feel special,
'cause you always make me feel like the only girl in the world.
I feel bad.
Don't feel bad.
No, I do, because today at the recital,
I couldn't stop looking at Becky's teacher.
I don't mind you looking.
I really don't.
Everybody looks.
I was looking today.
And I'm totally fine with that.
As long as he was gay, dead or a cartoon.
- G8Y- -0kay-
But no matter who or what we look at, we'll always come back to each other, right?
- Car wash!
- Car wash!
- Support our team!
- I'll prove it to you!
Car wash!
- What are you doing?
- No, no, you're gonna like this.
Hi, girls!
Come on.
Honey, you don't have to do this.
I want to.
Hi, girls!
Wash it up extra soapy!
You got it.
Wait, hang on.
There's a carjust in front of you.
Better do them first.
Yo, got a customer!
You take these guys, we'll take the yellow car.
Extra soapy.
What is happening right now?
I swear, I didn't plan this.
No, no, no, no.
Thank you.
I'm good.
I'm good, thank you.
Well, I might as well enjoy this.
Why is this never-ending?
At least the guys in the car in front of us are having fun.
What are you doing?
Get in there!
Let me do it.
Okay, everybody.
It wasn't a perfect day.
I admit it.
There were some downs.
Sorry about the leg.
The good news is the children got through another year of school.
Fabulously.
You got older, even though I told you not to.
Especially you.
Stay young.
Don't leave me.
You prepared us your famous chicken é la food poisoning, which we're all excited to eat.
I'm just kidding.
But the greatest thing is, it's my favorite part of the day with my four best friends.
To the Feders!
So Bumpty asked me out for ice cream today.
I "went out for ice cream" once with your dad.
Nine months later, Andre popped out.
This is the best vanilla pudding I've ever had.
That's butter, son.
Here you go.
- Want me to come in and feed it to you like I did the last time?
No, no.
I got my kid here.
That wouldn't be cool.
You said you loved me!
They're not all tens, buddy.
Homeboy, why aren't you eating?
I saw something today that made me lose my appetite.
What was it, me naked?
What?
What's a burpsmart?
Burpsnorp?
A burpsnart!
Basically, he burps, sneezes and farts at the same time.
He goes...
I think I just shat myself.
Hey, honey, what time's that Feder bash tonight?
What?
It's paint.
It doesn't come off.
I thought it might be fun to have a theme, no?
- A theme?
- Roxanne decided the theme is...
The '80s?
That was 70 years ago.
I thought we could go as Hall Oates.
Hall Oates?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What is that, like a cereal?
No.
Why don't you ask Nancy Arbuckle to come by for the get-together?
Or do you prefer the imaginary shower version?
You know what, Charlotte?
I trust you, and I want you to have fun tonight.
Really.
What's up, player?
I'm here for your daughter.
What...
Used to get 10 cases of beer for my parties, now I get 10 cases of juice boxes.
Hey, Beckster.
- Hey, Stud Muffin.
- Hey.
Mommy calls him Stud Muffin, so I call him Stud Muffin.
Is that right?
You must be Roxanne's husband.
I'm Kyle.
How do you know my wife again there, Mud Stuffing?
I worked her out this morning.
Really?
I worked her out this morning, too, pretty good.
All right.
Hi.
What's up?
This is awkward.
My husband's here.
Why is that awkward?
Why?
Well, let me give you a hint.
You have brain damage?
I think we both know what time it is, don't we?
What time is it?
Nothing.
It's just...
Just time to...
Help me out here.
I'm lost right now.
I'm sorry.
Wiley, how'd Andre McKenzie do?
Did he pass his test?
He squeaked by.
We didn't check out any soapy cheerleaders.
What's going on with you and my wife?
I'm gonna go.
Actually, why don't we all go our separate ways.
I don't see any of these conversations working out for me.
- Adios.
- I'll see you tonight.
Hey-
I'll bring the Hubba Bubba.
What?
Yeah, party tonight '80s-style, huh?
Rocky Ill.
- Wiley!
- Okay_
Hey, babe.
What does Penny's note say?
She wrote, "Mayonnaise, zitis..."
The other side.
"Meet me by your mailbox at 11:00."
Why would I meet her by my mailbox at 11:00?
You have any idea what just happened there?
Not a clue.
I don't care who your parents are.
You screw up, I fire you.
It's all good.
"It's all good"?
It's a family restaurant, not a rap show.
It's all bad?
That's right, it is.
You got a customer.
I'm sorry.
Welcome to the Ice Cream House.
Hi, Greg.
Nancy, hi.
I think you crushed your cones.
No.
That was a...
That was a squeeze test.
These cones failed.
We're gonna try cardboard cones next.
You're smiling.
And number two.
You have such a nice smile.
Thanks.
Go out with me tonight before your friends say I'm fugly.
Tonight?
Sure.
No freaking way.
Your father used to do that same three-step crap when we were growing up.
It always worked then.
Even on my wife.
I ain't no boy with a mind you can toy, 'cause if this is a ploy, I'll destroy Illinois.
It is so amazing how you can freestyle like that.
I been laying it down truthful since day one.
Well, I sing sometimes, too, but only, like, in the shower.
I'm scared to sing in front of other people.
If you scared, that means you don't got it.
Sorry to be blunt, but I don't front.
I'm hard-core.
Dinosaur!
How long ago was the '80s?
That was way back in the 1900s.
We learned about it in school.
It was wack.
The phones had long, curly things coming out of the end.
You had to watch commercials.
No way.
Isn't that right, Bowser?
How we doing?
Hey, Dad, why do we have to wear costumes and you don't?
I am wearing a costume.
Bruce Springsteen, Born in the U. S.A.
Who's Bruce Springsteen?
I guess some guy with a giant butt.
You don't know who the Boss is?
I stink as a father.
You do not stink as a father.
You're the best father I know.
That's why I don't understand why you don't...
Why I don't want a baby?
Because I don't want one!
Let's move on from that!
No. No, no.
Tell her it wasn't you talking, Dad.
It was your flabby ass.
You want me to "accidentally" break the other leg?
Hey, I'm sorry I raised my voice.
In front of the children!
Right, in front of the kids.
It's just, you...
All you're doing is bringing up this baby thing over and over.
Are you going through, like, a "womany" hormone situation or something?
Menopause?
What, you're not old enough for that?
Okay, no, I meant schizophrenia.
No, honey, honey, honey, if we have another baby, we're starting over, you know?
How about we just adopt a kid?
Like a 20-year-old who has a job.
That way we could make money off of him.
I just...
Don't you think we can start concentrating on me and you?
That's all I'm saying.
It's our time.
Well, I am going through kind of a hormone thing.
Good, there's pills for that.
I'm pregnant.
Our guests are here.
Wait a minute, when did we even have...
Damn you, Motel 6 hot tub!
Wow.
Lenny, that's big, brother.
Yeah, four kids is the best.
What are you talking about, Prince?
You told me it would be the worst if that happened.
There's a lot of great aspects to that.
Like, when Junior graduates high school, you'll be 64.
How is that a good thing?
Actually, it's horrifying.
I didn't do the math before I opened my mouth.
Nice job, Cher.
Okay, I'm not Cher.
I'm Meat Loaf, all right?
Yeah.
You're Meat Loaf, or you're made of meat loaf?
Who are you, Doug Henning?
I'm Oates.
Where's Hall?
Hall's having a playdate with your kids.
Anyway, you got nothing to worry about, Lenny.
All right?
You're a great dad.
Right, I know.
I broke my son's leg today.
That's a real good dad.
Guys, you're bumming me out, all right?
This is supposed to be party time.
This isn't gonna be a real party.
I'm drinking a juice box, 'cause I'm afraid my wife's gonna yell at me for getting drunk in front of the kids.
How many of you guys have been to a party in the past six months?
A party without a bouncy house.
A party where they actually invited you.
Yeah.
The party's over, fellas.
You saw the way those frat guys treated us today.
We're irrelevant.
We're losers.
We're old.
Lamonsoff totally surrendered.
He's got a fanny pack on now, for God's sake.
You know what, first of all, it's a "survanny" pack, a survival fanny pack, with many special features.
So you pull that triangle and lasagna comes out?
Why don't you give it a shot?
You got it.
I'll pull the string.
Like a raft out of hell!
Yeah, good one, that was good.
Don't ever say the party's over!
That didn't happen.
Hey, Richard Simmons is a hero.
No,no,no,no,no.
What's with all this Prince?
- I'm Prince.
- The hell.
You ain't Prince.
I'm Prince.
My skin's way lighter than yours.
You should have came as Seal on a hunger strike.
You look like Morgan Freeman if he was a transvestite.
And what you doing here, Bumpty?
I thought you was out with my daughter.
That ain't Bumpty.
That's my wife.
Mary!
I didn't recognize you.
Where's your costume?
I didn't find out about the party until it was too late.
So you decided to come as a black Muppet?
What?
Come on, you're my one and only, sweetie-boo-mo-mo.
Make a muscle for me?
Pwease?
So bulgy.
Like a big caramel apple.
Wow.
I'm scared.
I feel safe with you.
Shut up.
You know, I can make a connection with a woman.
I just can't sustain it.
You know, there's a distance there.
Try to fill it up pharmaceutically, you know, with pills, or the Discovery Channel, or Dino Nuggets.
But nothing really works.
See, you understand, you know?
'Cause you're, I heard, sensitive to men.
God, he's hot!
Zip it!
He'll find out our secret!
- Drink up, partner.
- Yeah!
Lenny!
Secret table.
Yes, honey, how are you?
What's going on?
We just trying to get our punch on.
Becky's sleepy-
She wants her daddy to put her to bed.
Well, Daddy's right about to enjoy some refreshing punch, so could you put her to sleep?
Well, you wouldn't want to have too much punch with all these kids running around.
You know what, I'd be okay with that.
Actually, you wouldn't.
Gotcha.
I'll be back soon, fellas.
I'll be back soon.
That's a promise.
- Let's go, little girl.
- Good night.
Time to go to sleep.
Close your eyes.
Yeah, Mom.
As easy as making a free throw.
Hey, Bean, Becky went to sleep.
I think it's time for you to hit it, pal.
What do you say?
No, no, don't touch that.
Yeah, you might break it.
What...
Where did you learn how to do that?
I saw it in one of my dreams.
You're a genius?
My boy's a genius.
Your dad's also a genius.
Sweet dreams there, angel, okay?
Daddy, can you lay in bed with me till I fall asleep?
What do you mean?
I thought you are sleepy.
That's why we came up here.
Please lay down.
I'll lay down with you, then.
I just...
There's a party going on, but...
Can you tell me a story?
Look who was in the neighborhood!
Some of Lenny's friends from the old J. Geils Band!
- Daddy?
- You don't want one slug?
No.
I thought you liked this stuff.
Sorry.
All right.
I'll tell you a story.
Once upon a time, there was a hand, and the hand faced-raked the child.
Sleep!
Slee...
Sleep!
Boy, Feder's cranking his old rock and roll records pretty loud.
Guess he's never heard of neighbors.
Now, why you stopping here?
I need some air.
You need some air?
- We haven't even gotten to the party yet.
- I would appreciate it if you would stop trying to "manage" me.
Word, word.
Want me to stay and wait with you?
I just want to be alone!
Yo, don't believe the hype.
Boy!
Daddy, I can't fall asleep without Mr. Gigglesworth.
You told me he would be okay.
He Will be.
I...
He just needs to rest a little bit longer, okay?
Please, Daddy.
I need to see him.
He had a very rough day.
But I'll get him for you, because you need to see him.
Doing leg lifts.
I work out when I can, you know?
Want some Daddy candy right here?
Why are you naked?
Global warming.
Why is this empty?
- Where is Gigglesworth?
- Hey, hey.
I'm sorry, man.
Were you looking for this?
Why's he look good?
I sewed him.
You sew?
Where'd you learn how to sew?
Gay camp-
You went to gay camp?
You're gay?
No, no.
No, I mean, I'm gay, but no, there's no such thing as gay camp, man. it was a joke.
I learned to sew from my dad, who was a tailor.
I've been sewing since I was Becky's age.
Here.
This is great.
Gigglesworth's okay, you're not fooling around with my wife, and you got a pee stain.
That is not mine.
You're an animal.
I am the law!
Can you dig it?
Come on, big man, Lenny's got, like, 12 bathrooms.
I don't got to go to the bathroom.
I'm just enjoying the water.
Get out.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Fluzoo, come on!
That's not even warm.
It's hot.
I got to give it to your old man for one thing.
He could always throw a party.
This is my dad's party?
Check out your girlfriend in the Pat Benatar outfit.
Charlotte, that was amazing.
Where'd you learn to sing like that?
No place.
I just sing a little in the shower.
Maybe you should stick to the shower.
'Cause I gots the power
I'm on Today Show Dissing Matt Lauer
Bumptv!
Do me a favor and shut your mouth before I slap that Mohawk into a chin strap.
What?
Hey-
Who invited you guys?
Your beautiful wife does.
Well, she invited her, and naturally, we assumed it was a plus one.
There a problem?
No, I was gonna say, great Terminator outfit and Robert Palmer thing you got on, and...
Nice babble.
- How about this?
- No.
What about that?
Does that hurt?
Is that hurting you?
Yes, it is hurting me.
Okay.
Well, let me do it some more.
You got something to say?
Actually, Cavanaugh.
You want to stay at my party, I think you owe me an apology.
For what?
For back in the day, always giving me crap.
You don't want to let bygones be bygones?
I do.
After you apologize to me.
For stuff I did 30 years ago?
There isn't a statute of limitations on being a dick.
What'd you just say?
I said what I said.
You and me are fighting right now.
Now, let's go!
Let's get it over with.
Man, looks like our friend's about to die.
Lenny, what's going on?
I'm calling the police!
We're already here.
Hold my hair, woman.
You ready for this?
Not at all, but I'm gonna do this, 'cause I got to show my son what's right.
We'd do anything for our boys, wouldn't we?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
My boy's over in Afghanistan.
Well, you raised him right.
I hope he gets home safe soon.
Yeah, me, too.
Sucker-punch him, Feder.
Lick his bicep.
Lick it, bite it, lick the tan off.
All right, here's what's gonna happen.
Hit me right on the chin.
I'll go down like a sack of potatoes.
- What are you talking about?
- Just do it.
I know you'd do the same for me if my boy was watching.
Let's get busy, Hollywood!
No!
Don't hit me, please!
I'm sorry.
Please don't hit me.
You would tear me limb from limb.
Open this.
The only reason I picked on you was because I was afraid of you.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
Please, please, please.
Just go with it.
I didn't think anyone would believe you could knock me out.
Please.
Don't hit me.
Cavanaugh's crying.
This is ridiculous!
Cavanaugh.
You mean you don't want me to hit you with this?
No!
Please.
Or the elbow?
Finger in the eye!
- Wow.
- Listen to this guy!
All right, get up.
Straighten up.
I'm not gonna hit you, but if you ever disrespect me or anybody,
I will hunt you down, and I will slap you into a pile of tattoos, bad breath and back zits.
Please.
Do you understand me?
Yes, I understand you.
Do you understand me?
Yes, I understand you!
Then walk away before I change my mind.
Thank you very much.
- Hey, man, look at him!
-What just happened?
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!
Oh, my God, that was the manliest thing you ever did.
You get extra special hip-hop dance tonight.
Word up.
Hey, guys, if you see Leonard, could you tell him that I'm here waiting like we arranged?
GUYS?
Guys?
Yeah, okay.
Okay, I am a person!
- That was awesome, by the way.
- Had to. Had to.
Yeah, yeah, you had to.
He let you off the hook, didn't he?
He did, he did, but I had to go With it.
I can't believe it!
We hit the moron jackpot!
Everybody who needs a beating, conveniently together on one lawn.
Who are they?
Brunson University frat guys.
Oh, God, I hate white people.
Excuse me, why are you here?
What's the matter?
I tell you what is the matter.
These old townies trashed our frat house!
And nobody treats our good-times headquarters with disrespect!
Yeah!
They didn't do it.
Me do it.
Don't try and cover for him, Z-Dog!
Who's Z-Dog?
We know they're trying to get back at us for making them do the naked plunge in our swimming hole.
Your swimming hole?
I've been swimming at the quarry since I was eight years old.
Apparently, everybody in this crap town has been swimming there since they were eight years old.
I guess nobody wants to leave this dump because they're too busy sucking!
We'll finish later.
- You promise?
- I promise.
- Okay.
-Hey, smart guy!
Lenny Feder left this town, moved to Hollywood, made big bucks, probably more money than all you brainiacs put together ever will.
But guess what?
He came back here.
'Cause this beautiful town is his home.
And it always will be his home.
Well, that was just a moving testament to this community, bro!
But we didn't come here to hear any lame speeches.
We came here to kick some old, smelly ass!
Fellas, we may be old.
We may be smelly.
We may have a penis.
But the only ones getting their ass kicked around here is gonna be you spoiled, privileged, uppity, preppy D-bags.
You hear that?
Now, let's get busy!
They're dancing on the ceiling
They're dancing on the floor
People everywhere coming through the door
They know there's a party going on
Come on, son!
You ain't tough!
Hit him!
Yeah, Braden!
Yeah!
Damn!
You want this?
Sir, please stop it!
That's not a sir!
That's a woman!
My woman!
Come on, babe.
I know you're gonna lose control
You can do
Oh, you're so hot.
I know it's cold outside
Don't bust my face!
You saved me.
I will protect you for the rest of your life.
Okay, blow dryer boy.
Oh, God, no!
No!
No!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Having a good anniversary, babe?
Honey, the best.
I can't breathe.
Choking me!
Yeah!
We did it.
We did it, man.
Yeah.
We make a good team.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was fun.
I know it's cold outside
Come on, babe, I'll keep you satisfied
Boomer!
What's going on?
This!
You're a traitor, Boomer!
His name's not Boomer!
It's Gary.
It's Greg.
Greg.
Oh, my God!
Did you see his head?
He's got a...
He's bald!
I got a wild one!
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Nobody noogies my brother!
My brain!
My brain!
B.U.!
Hey, man!
I had that one.
I know you did, big brother.
- Get out of here!
- Don't hit me!
Hey, hey, look who showed up.
Flippy-boy.
Yeah, you want to flip your way out of this?
Too slow, old man.
Where you work out, Cinnabon?
Look who's back up, baby.
I didn't know we were kicking.
Give me a second to stretch.
All right.
We're gonna throw some legs, huh?
You want to throw some legs, huh?
Boom!
That just happened.
What, were you raised by ninjas?
Congratulations.
You won the fight.
Here's your prize.
Thanks, little girl.
It looks just like you.
It's a monkey!
Look at me!
I'm a stupid little monkey.
Good night.
Come on, guys!
We got to get out!
Let's go!
Lenny!
Baby.
- Baby, are you all right?
- I'm coming for you, Leonard!
I'm here for you, Leonard.
I'm here for you.
Who...
Who are you?
It's your pretty, shiny Penny.
Oops, sorry, I kicked your barrette.
Sorry, honey!
You guys were Fuji and Tanaka out there.
This is just like high school.
Get drunk, get in a fight, wind up back at Lamonsoff's, eating eggs.
Except for the drunk part, Mommy.
All you guys together brings back so many memories.
- Dickie, is this you and Lenny?
- Let's see.
Yeah, me and Hollywood were best friends in kindergarten.
- Yep.
- What happened?
What do you mean, "What happened?" We were in different classes.
We kind of drifted apart, right?
Yeah.
He was in those smart classes.
I was in the other classes.
Hey, who's this guy?
- Anybody remember him?
- Who is that?
Wow, what happened to that kid?
He's still here.
Why do I know my new kid's gonna end up looking like that?
- You're having a baby, Lenny?
- Yeah.
Yeah, so I'm told, Mrs. Lamonsoff.
A surprise, huh?
Yes.
People today try to plan things out so much.
But don't think an unexpected child is loved any less than one you planned for.
Someday, Lenny, you won't even remember what life was like with just three children.
You think we wanted Eric?
- He was an accident.
- Mama.
His father and I were in the men's room at a Patriots game...
You know what, I think I'm just gonna turn the page here.
I'm turning the page.
Finish the story!
Officer Dante's passed out on our lawn.
I know.
I saw him trying to arrest an anthill.
Want to talk about the whole pregnancy thing?
It's okay.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay, you go to sleep.
I'll make this between me and the baby.
Hello in there.
This is your daddy speaking.
I just want to tell you welcome to the family, and I love you very, very, very much.
I really don't care if you're a boy or girl.
I just need you to promise me one thing.
When you're in elementary school, study ballet, so I can see that teacher as much as possible.
Hey-
I knew that was coming.
To be honest, I don't need no stinking ballet teacher.
I'm married to the most beautiful woman in the world, your mommy.
Are you saying sweet things to me because you want to fool around?
That would be a nice way to kick off the summer.
Okay, Mr. Romantic.
But let's do this quick, we have a big day tomorrow, okay?
Absolutely.
Watch your head in there.
Hang on.
Hang on. I'm sorry, honey.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Oh, my God, I'm going to!
I did it!
I burpsnarted!
Yes!
Lenny, grow up!
I did it for the baby!
Are you seriously trying to rope-a-dope me?
That's an old man's move.
- I am old man.
-No, you're not.
But you box like one.
Not bad.
Come on, Ben.
You're telegraphin'.
Mr. President.
Ten minutes, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, Forbes.
Hey.
You're not supposed to hit the president.
Yeah.l know.
I'll get you next time.
Yeah.
I'm sure you will.
Perimeter's secure.
Weather's getting worse out there, but we're advised it's drivable.
Post vehicles to stand by.
Good evening, Mr. President.
Five minutes, sir.
Thanks, Mike.
- Evening, ma'am.
- Merry Christmas, Mike.
The president gets us off our dependence on foreign oil... yet he cannot help a wife choose an earring.
Uh, small one.
Classic look for a classic lady.
Good chat.
Kiss ass.
Well, I love you both but I am going with the long.
I hate going to these fundraisers.
Why don't you go for me?
Oh, honey.
You're perfect.
God forbid people know we kiss.
Now the real bloodbath starts when your mom catches you playing this.
You suck.
You suck worse.
Come on.
Well, he likes it when you call him Dries... because it makes him feel like, I don't know, you're pals or something.
Hey, love.
You wanna open a gift before we go?
It's not love, and I'm gonna wait 'til everyone else is here.
Keep forgetting.
Sorry.
Do I really have to come with you guys?
I mean, I've been on so many.
Re-election's hard work, buddy.
Sorry, pal.
Can I at least ride with Mike?
You'll have to ask him.
He's the boss.
Mike, do I get to ride with you?
Okay.
All right.
Okay, Diaz.
You're riding in the Beast tonight.
Merry Christmas.
Thank you, sir.
You okay to stay back and watch the fort tonight?
You kidding me?
In this weather?
Get out of this monkey suit, sit by the fire, watch "Breaking Bad?" Fine by me.
My own little retirement party?
Leave the babysitter alone, all right?
- Are you going to wear that hat?
- I like the hat.
I think it's fine.
It's age appropriate.
- You take it off when you get inside.
- No, the girls dig it.
Mustang, this is Big Top.
Bringing out the full package.
Let's go.
Package is on the move.
ETA to Morgan residence, 22 minutes.
Keep it tight, everybody.
Hey, Connor.
Come on. Scoot back.
Put your belt on.
What if I don't?
Then O'Neil here's gonna punch in the nuts.
Come on.
You keeping 180 degrees awareness?
I thought you said it was 360.
Yeah, I was just checkin'.
Setting me up is what you're doing.
All right.
So, how many emergency exits
-in the West Wing?
-8. How many feet from the Oval Office to the PEOC elevator?
116.
From doors closing in the elevator, how long does it take to get to the PEOC?
Four minutes.
Security cameras?
How many have audio?
Only the ones in the common areas.
- Not bad.
-Kid's got it, huh?
Yeah, we're gonna make a Secret Service agent outta you yet.
You just need to remember to keep your seatbelt on.
That's right.
Gosh, it's really coming down.
I've been thinking about shaving my head.
That sounds good.
It's getting worse out there.
Bring it down to five.
Merry Christmas, Mr. President.
You shouldn't have.
My God.
It's my grandfather's watch.
How did you find this?
Just have my ways.
Thank you.
You're just welcome.
Now, let's talk about that shaved head idea.
You were listening.
You didn't think I was listening,
-did you?
-Very clever.
You ever been to a billionaire's Christmas party before, Diaz?
- No, sir.
-They're over-rated.
Yes, sir.
Oh, my gosh.
Look what I found.
Where'd that come from?
Merry Christmas.
Stop, stop, stop!
Hey, Connor, stay right there!
Clear communications, it's Diaz.
- First lady's injured.
-Connor.
Get some weight on the back!
O'Neil, get on the back!
I'm gonna get this door!
- Don't anybody move inside!
Don't move!
- Mike! Maggie!
- Sir?
-Seatbelt's stuck!
Sir, get out of the car!
I'll take care of her!
Keep your weight on the back, O'Neil!
- Hold it back!
- Roma, open the fucking door!
It's jammed!
It's fucking jammed!
Pull her out that side!
It's going down!
it's going down!
O'Neil, goddamn it!
Hold it down!
Hold it down!
- Mike, it's going!
-Hold it back!
Mike, take Maggie!
Shit.
Sir, I'm sorry!
- Watch out, it's going!
-Maggie!
No, Mike!
No!
Mom!
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
And I don't like going to barbecues by myself, you know?
North Korean maneuvers along the DMZ continue to ring alarm bells... throughout Pacific markets, even as President Asher... is set to meet this afternoon with South Korean...
Babe, we out of coffee?
I don't know.
Are we?
All right, just...
I thought you said that anything...
You were saying?
I was saying, I'll get some more coffee.
Great.
So, how was the barbecue I missed?
It was actually kind of fun.
You might have enjoyed it.
Yeah?
Paula's got this new boyfriend who's very sweet... but he's working in the same department as her ex, Alex.
Remember Alex?
Anyway, Alex ended up showing up at the party... which was really weird for Paula, who was... overwhelmed.
Mike, you're not listening to me.
I was listening.
You were talking about
-patty's boyfriend and she's...
-No.
Paula and Paula's boyfriend.
You've met Paula.
It's okay, Mike.
We'll talk about it later.
All right, babe.
I'm sorry.
But I tell you what.
Why don't we go see a movie tonight?
Okay?
Just the two of us.
Or you can bring Paula and Patty and their boyfriends.
You know what I think we should do?
I think we should take that holiday that we've been talking about.
All right?
You, me, the ocean.
Come on.
It'll be like the honeymoon we never had.
We didn't have a honeymoon?
Thanks.
So, how was your Fourth?
My fourth what?
Fourth of July.
Don't be an ass.
Some people do take holidays, you know.
Yeah, it was quiet.
You know, we stayed in.
We?
Okay.
I stayed in. She went out.
I'm shocked.
Ms. Jacobs?
- Good morning.
-Director.
- How are you, buddy?
-Hey, Roma.
- Good to see you, partner.
- How's the family?
- The kids are good.
Thank you.
-Yeah.
- O'Neil.
-Hey, Banning.
You're looking sharp.
So, we missed you for, poker, uh, last week.
Where were you?
Missed taking your money.
Yeah, I know.
I've been working the late shift.
Yeah, non-stop action over there at the Treasury.
You gotta do what you gotta do, right?
Yeah.
You guys got a big day coming up, huh?
You got the Koreans coming in?
Nah, I mean, you know.
Business as usual.
Hey, I wanted to introduce you.
This is Agent Jones.
You've heard of Mike Banning, haven't you?
Yeah, yeah.
The guy who told the Speaker of the House to go fuck himself.
Don't you guys have somewhere to be?
- Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Mike.
Good seein' you.
- Yeah, you too.
- Come Thursday night, all right?
- Okay.
Seven o'clock.
Not getting any easier, huh?
No.
I want back in.
Desk job's killing me.
Mike.
Everybody knows you did the right thing on that bridge.
Hell, even the president knows.
He just doesn't want to see you and have to be reminded of it every day.
He never even stopped to grieve properly.
Just, give it some time.
How's Connor?
President's son, misses his mom.
Hell of a gig.
Misses his buddy though.
Yeah, he's a good kid.
Is he still sneaking around the White House, making everybody crazy?
Oh, I wonder who taught him that.
You know, the first time you walked into my office out of the darkness... you needed therapy then.
Never mind now.
And you don't exactly do yourself any favors.
Where are you going with this?
Mike.
Look, you gotta learn how to get back into the real world.
That's good, Jacobs.
Let me write that one down.
Hey, Jacobs.
Thanks.
I'll be in touch.
Hey, buddy.
What do you think of this?
- Which one do you like?
-I don't know.
Okay, you take that one.
I'll take this one.
- Maggie!
Maggie! - I'll take care of her!
Sir!
No!
No, Mike!
Mr. Foss came in. Chest pains.
About an hour ago.
Hey, it's Leah.
You've reached my phone.
You know what to do.
Just checking in.
Listen, I'll call you later.
Bye.
Get some fishing in.
Hit the bag together.
Be fun.
I hate Camp David.
Do we really have to go?
Can't we go somewhere else?
You know, the beach?
Yeah.
The beach does kinda sound better.
Hey.
I've got three minutes.
Let's run down to the kitchen and get some ice cream.
Yeah.
Chocolate chip or rocky road?
I'm gonna have rocky road before you eat it all, like you did the last time.
- I don't remember it that way.
- Yeah, you did.
Come in.
Mr. President, we're ready for you.
- Already?
-Yes, sir.
Sorry, buddy.
It's okay, Dad.
All right.
I'll see you soon.
Minister Lee is going to want you to issue a joint statement, Mr. President... threatening military action to get the North Koreans... to stand down from the border and stop their missile tests.
Which I think we should give them.
Ruth?
Provided that the North Koreans are rational... which is dicey, at best.
We bluff.
They call it.
Then what?
Well, who says we'd be bluffing?
Personally, I like to try to avoid a war.
Charlie?
I think I agree with Ruth on this one, Mr. President.
Thank you for sitting in, Mr. Speaker.
- Yes, sir.
- I won't hold you up any longer.
- Hello, Mr. Speaker.
-Hello, Janie.
What time is Minister Lee due to arrive?
7:00 this evening.
Our guests have arrived.
Prime Minister Lee.
I'm Special Agent-in-Charge Roma.
I'd like to welcome you to the White House, sir.
Thank you.
May I introduce my Head of Security and Chief Aide, Mr. Park.
My pleasure.
Prime Minister, after you, please.
Agent Davis will be taking care of your security team outside.
Prime Minister, if you would follow Agent O'Neil, please?
Ma'am?
Private sector looks good on you, Dave.
Yeah, something to look forward to.
Yeah.
How've you been?
I'll tell you.
I miss the Secret Service.
Best years of my life.
It misses you too, old man.
I could still kick your ass.
At what?
Dominos?
-It's good to see you, my friend.
- You, too.
Unidentified flight, this is Flight Leader, U.S. Air Force aircraft at your starboard wing.
You've entered restricted airspace.
Unidentified flight, you must divert immediately to vector 0-2-0.
Acknowledge.
I'm sorry to have disrupted your vacation.
Please.
I'm glad you could come.
Mr. Lee, we have a mutual problem.
And I think together, I'm confident we can find a solution.
Thank you, Mr. President.
That's why I'm here.
As you know, North Korea has a one million man standing army... less than 50 kilometers from our capital.
The threat is real.
Unidentified flight.
You must divert immediately to vector 0-2-0.
This is your final warning.
You will be shot down.
Acknowledge.
Anti-aircraft.
We're taking fire.
Mr. Lee, I'm sure you can appreciate that this is...
Sir? There's been an incursion.
Please stand up.
Let's go.
Move!
- Mr. Lee, please join us.
- That's not protocol, sir.
He's coming with us!
Move, move, move!
Get him to the elevator.
- Go!
Go! -Find Connor!
Code 9-9-9.
Go. go, go!
Move!
Keep moving!
Get that elevator open now!
Give me four minutes, Mr. President.
Harden down on Olympus.
Air support on the way.
ETA, four minutes.
Code Red.
Air space 1 and 2 compromised.
Robert, Delta, Ready One.
Move to West Corridor!
Move to West Corridor!
This way, please.
This is not a drill.
Evacuate immediately.
All units, 9-9-9.
I repeat, all units, 9-9-9.
Let's move!
Find my son.
Sylvio, find Sparkplug immediately.
You okay, Mr. President?
Sir.
This way.
Over here.
Go on!
Get down!
Get down!
Stay down!
Don't move!
Get down!
Get out of the way!
Take cover!
PPD Command, this is Wolfhound 6.
Have bogey in sight.
Wolfhound 6, fire at will.
Repeat, fire at will.
Acknowledge.
Mr. President?
We have confirmation that the bogey is down, sir.
Thank you, Jones.
Activate Compound One.
I want open lines to the Pentagon, Homeland Security and NSA.
Charlie.
Coordinate with the Air Force and FAA.
- Find out if that's a lone aircraft.
- Yes, sir.
Half hour at the most.
Ruth.
Where the hell is my son?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, get the fuck down!
Mr. Lee.
We've had a problem.
- Please have patience with us.
-Got it. - Mr. President.
-Yes?
It's a critical message.
The White House is under ground attack.
Officer on deck!
Rapid Response Team from Andrews, get 'em moving!
At ease.
How bad is it?
Front fence has been breached.
We've got a C-130 burning on the South Lawn and a gunfight raging on the North.
Fucking shitting me.
Where's the president?
In the bunker.
- Get me the Pentagon on the line now!
- Yes, sir!
It's happening.
Mr. President!
Forbes, what are you doing?
- Move!
-For God's sakes, Forbes.
Forbes!
What are you doing?
Shut up!
Come on.
Tim.
Come on.
Hang in there!
Hey!
Ah, shit.
Where's the president?
I don't know!
Goddamn it!
Where's that response team?
- They're 5 minutes out, sir, but...
- But what?
We have a hostage situation on our hands.
P.E.O.C.'s gone offline.
Go back!
Get back now!
Go back!
Fuck!
RPG!
Get in!
Get inside!
Get inside!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Go, go!
Move!
Fall back, fall back!
Let's go, let's go!
- They're down the hall!
- Shit, we've only got four guys left!
Hold your positions, you understand?
I got this door.
Cover the other one.
Olympus has fallen.
Olympus has fallen.
Olympus has fallen.
Fuck you!
They've taken the White House.
Command, Sniper Team One, in position.
We're coming from the White House.
So far, the perimeter's been set.
We're waiting on more intel to come in right now, and once we do...
Bravo team's gonna breach.
- Wait for my command to execute.
Not since the British burned down the White House in the War of 1812... has an enemy force occupied the center of American power.
The White House, the most protected building on Earth, has fallen.
Sir, we have a hot feed from the P.E.O.C.
Mr. Lee.
Sir, are you safe?
Are you with the president?
Sir, can you hear m...?
Oh, my God.
Don't negotiate.
Sir?
I have your commander-in-chief.
Now, stand down.
Who are you?
I am the man in control of your White House.
Now, stand your men down.
- Stand down!
-Sir.
All units, stand down!
Ladies and gentlemen we are at DEFCON 4.
How could you?
- Put your hands up.
-Fuck you.
No!
There is a reason I never voted for you.
Don't do it, Forbes!
It takes 15 minutes for your Armed Forces to reach the White House.
We took it down in 13.
Hurry, we need a wheelchair.
In Triage, do you want me to color code them or number code them?
Color code 'em.
Okay, Pam, we still need to take the vitals.
Call, Mike.
Mike.
The cellular service in the area you are calling has been suspended temporarily.
I got head trauma, six-year-old girl, she's fading!
Bring Mr. Asher here.
What are you doing, for Christ's sake?
Oh, sir!
I have no interest in your nuclear launch codes.
By now your Pentagon has changed then, no?
Sit.
You from the North?
You sure as hell are not from the South.
I'm working for justice.
To give millions of starving men, women and children a chance at more than just subsistence.
To end the civil war your country interrupted so long ago.
And yes... for a united, prosperous Korea.
It's a whole new world, baby.
What's the going rate for souls these days?
What'd you say to me?
I never would have taken you for a traitor.
Me?
What about you?
You sold this country out long before I ever did.
Globalization and fucking Wall Street.
What's it cost to buy a presidency nowadays anyway?
$500 million?
I'm a fucking rookie compared to you!
Gotta keep your gloves up, Forbes.
Enough!
What about Connor?
What the fuck are you gonna do with my son?
Mr. Speaker.
As both the President and the Vice President of the United States are unable to discharge the duties of their offices
I'm officially placing you under Secret Service protection.
You are the Acting President of the United States.
Are they alive?
They are.
Sir, North Korea is denying any involvement in the attack.
We've secured the perimeter of the White House... and cleared a 10-block radius.
Sir, they've also assassinated the South Korean Prime Minister.
We have contact from inside the White House.
Trace confirms it's the president's Sat phone.
Put it through!
Mr. President?
Negative.
-Identify yourself.
-Echelon Four.
That's one of yours?
- Designator?
-Oscar Zulu 309.
Jesus.
Banning?
Where are you?
I'm in the Oval Office.
Is the president in the bunker?
- He...
-Can we trust him?
Banning was one of our best agents.
Mr. Speaker, I just have to say, this is Mike Banning.
This is the same guy that was removed from the president's detail...
-after the accident
-Whoa, whoa,
-when we lost the first lady?
- Ray!
Ray!
Ray! - You wanna add something?
- Well, what's he doing
- I suggest you get your facts straight.
-In the White House right now?
- How do we know we can trust this guy?
Banning is ex-Special Forces, Ranger Battalion
He will move mountains or die trying.
I know him.
Does anyone else in this room have any intelligence coming out of the White House?
Then we have no choice.
Yes.
The president's in the bunker.
He's being held hostage.
What do they want?
We're trying to find out.
Who's in charge?
Trumbull.
- Are there any survivors with you?
- Negative, sir.
They wiped us out.
They have commandos roaming the hallways... with enough explosives to take out an army.
Looks like the doors and windows are rigged with C-4 explosives.
Who knows what other tricks they have up their sleeves?
Any team coming in is gonna be ringing the front doorbell pretty loud.
They shut the power down.
Lights off.
And I assume they closed the air vents.
I killed the surveillance, but I don't know how long that's gonna last.
Where's Connor?
Oh, we have no status of his location, but he's presumed to still be inside.
Well, they're looking for him.
They have his photo.
Sir...
I'm here.
Use me.
Okay, Banning.
Sit tight.
We'll get back with you.
Sir, we have a hot feed from the P.E.O.C.
- Mr. Speaker.
-What is it you want?
Recall the Seventh Fleet from the Sea of Japan.
And withdraw all 28,500 American troops from the Demilitarized Zone.
If you do not comply.
If you attempt any operation to retake this building...
-if you deviate from my instructions...
- Wait a minute.
We can't just recall the Seventh Fleet.
Then I will execute your officials one by one... and their blood will be on your hands.
You have until dawn.
I suggest you move quickly.
Who is that guy?
Well, sir, we're running facial recognition on him right now.
Well, he cleared as part of the South Korean security detail.
If we recall the Fleet, and leave the DMZ... Seoul, all of South Korea could fall within 72 hours, sir.
But if we do nothing, they kill Asher, the vice president... and his entire National Security team.
And Connor, if he's in there.
Mary, get me some coffee
Half-and-half, three Sweet 'N Lows.
In a real cup.
Not one of those paper or Styrofoam things.
All right.
Let's secure all nuclear sites.
Get me our expert on North Korea.
Then I want to speak with the Premiere of North Korea on a secure line.
After that, I wanna speak with the Russians, the Chinese, the British and the French.
And set up a press conference.
In that order.
The United States of America doesn't negotiate with terrorists.
Who said anything about negotiating?
Admiral Hoenig, your Cerberus code.
You kill him, you won't get the code.
I will not ask again.
- Give it to him, Joe.
-Mr. President.
You'll never get mine.
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.
Louder.
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.
What the hell?
Get me Homeland Security.
No, now!
Sir.
NORAD reports a Cerberus code has been entered.
Jesus.
Jacobs, I got something coming your way.
I got a clean commando in front of me.
- What is that?
-Is he alive?
Ask me a serious question.
Anybody around the table?
We don't recognize it.
Well, whoever they are, they're fucking good.
They're well-trained and they're well-organized.
But I guess you know that already.
Get that over to Langley.
So, what have you got?
Talk to me.
They want us to recall the Seventh Fleet and pull our troops out.
Oh, is that all?
A Cerberus code has been entered.
What's Cerberus?
That's classified.
Classified?
Really?
Well, right now I think I have the proverbial need-to-fucking-know.
Cerberus is a highly-classified military protocol.
A 3-pronged fail-safe in the case of an inadvertent nuclear launch.
It allows us to access the self-destruct mechanism in our lCBM's in-flight.
So even if one of our nuclear warheads was launched and we wanted to abort.
Cerberus is the only way to stop it from reaching its target.
No one person has all three codes.
It's parceled out to the president, Secretary of Defense... and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
All of whom are in the president's bunker right now.
With those codes, they can destroy any long-range nuke that we fire.
And that would make America vulnerable to a nuclear strike.
So, change the codes.
We can't.
Cerberus was designed as a self-contained total-isolation system.
The only way to change the codes is physically on the computer itself.
Which is located in the president's bunker.
So, now we know why they wanted the president's son.
The president will hold out as long as he can.
But if they get his son... if they hurt him... well... nobody could hold out under those circumstances.
So, find Connor get him the hell out of there.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Forbes.
Who is that?
Mike Banning.
And who might that be?
He was on the president's protection detail for a few years.
Are we worried about him?
Hell no.
No.
He should be.
Did Truman gut the White House interior in 1948 or '49?
I believe it was '49.
Steel frame over the old stone walls.
Yes?
Connor!
- How're you doing?
Okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
I see this is still your favorite hiding place, huh?
I've got Sparkplug-
Finally, some good news.
He's safe.
I'm bringing him out.
What about my dad?
Your dad's gonna be fine, okay?
Nothing bad's gonna happen.
We're gonna get him outta here.
- Okay?
-Yeah.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
- You ready to haul ass?
-Yeah.
Okay, stay close.
Okay.
Come on.
Okay, come on.
All right, kiddo.
Keep an eye out, okay?
Watch my six.
Jacobs.
Okay, I have Sparkplug.
He's coming out in a ventilation shaft in the northwest corner, ground floor.
Have the green party waiting.
We'll be there.
How are you gonna fit through that?
You're coming with me, right?
I gotta go get your dad.
All right.
Now, listen, you can do this.
Now, you remember chimney climbing I taught you on the Rose Garden wall?
Yeah?
So, that's all it is.
Okay?
It's one foot against the front wall, one foot against the back.
Now, all the way to the top.
- Mike?
-Yeah.
I'm scared.
Yeah, me too.
But you're gonna get through it.
You're one of us now.
This is yours.
Put that on.
Now, I'm counting on you, kiddo.
Okay.
Good man.
All right.
Let's go.
There you go, kiddo.
I'm gonna push you on up, okay?
I'll see you on the other side.
Now, keep movin'.
Sparkplug is on his way up.
Oh, Jacobs, hold on.
Connor, wait up.
- False alarm.
Go.
-Okay.
He's coming out, Jacobs.
Hold your position.
Hostiles in the area.
Go, go, go!
It's clear.
CIB-1.
Going in.
You okay?
Coming out.
Hostile moving toward the ledge.
Hustle up.
Sparkplug received.
Good job, Banning.
Now, let's see if we can get the president out.
Roger that.
I want to reassure all Americans and everyone around the world that despite today's events our government remains 100% functional.
We know that the president is alive.
To our friends, we are grateful for your loyalty and support.
As a nation, we are never stronger than when tested.
We will remain united and strong.
God bless you all and God bless these United States of America.
Okay, asshole.
Yo.
Hey.
Who's running the show?
Oh, you speak English?
They teach you that where you come from?
'Cause you know what they teach me?
Is how to extract information from people like you.
That's funny, huh?
No, it's funny.
I know.
I get it.
Yeah.
I guess I'm a little rusty.
I liked your friend though.
He seems like a funny guy.
What's your leader's name?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here.
How many men do you have?
In English.
His name is Yeonsak Kang.
He's the head of the KUF.
The paramilitary organization?
No surprises there.
40 commandos breached the gate and 28 are left.
How do we know we can trust the information?
I just asked them nicely.
Kang Yeonsak?
Sir, this is one of the most wanted terrorists in the world.
He was brought across the DMZ as a child after his father was executed for crimes against the North Korean state.
While they were crossing the border, his mother was killed by an American landmine.
This guy masterminded the 2004 bombing of the British Embassy in Seoul.
And he funneled Pyongyang uranium enrichment technology from Pakistan.
He's never before been photographed or identified by any Western intelligence agency.
Well, Jesus Christ, nobody ever thought to look for him inside the South Korean government.
Look, I don't care who he is.
With a force that size
I have men who can sweep 'em out in short order.
Sir, this is not going to be a cakewalk.
These sons of bitches are pretty fucking tough.
I've got the toughest fuckin' guys in the world.
What we need to know is how to get into that bunker.
Once those blast doors close, you don't.
It's nuclear hardened.
Now, there used to be some old tunnels, but they were sealed up years ago.
Sir, your men need to know what the hell they're dropping into.
Do not launch anything until I do some recon.
Agent Banning.
Yes, I know who you are.
Welcome to my house.
Hey, asshole.
What took you so long?
You're the one that let the first lady die, no?
And soon, the president.
Failure seems to be a habit with you.
Yeah, well...
Maybe I owe you for giving me the chance for making up for that today.
I admire you for acknowledging your failure.
But there's no going back.
Nothing you try and do here tonight can atone.
Yeah, maybe not.
But I reckon fucking your shit up will be a pretty good start.
You may wanna take a headcount. The bodies are piling up.
I have more than enough men to finish the mission.
Oh, and by the way, if you're looking for Connor... he's on his way to the baseball game.
How's your wife, Michael?
Leah.
She's a nurse.
Saves lives.
Too bad she will not save yours.
You know what?
Why don't you and I play a game of fuck off?
You go first.
Go kill him.
Enough!
Enough!
Madam Secretary.
Your Cerberus code.
No!
Ruth!
Your code!
You'll have to kill me.
As you wish.
There's a saying... in Korea.
Seeing something a 100 times... is not as good as living it once.
Fuck you.
Stop!
Enough!
Enough!
Stop!
Enough!
Give it to him, Ruth.
It doesn't matter.
And he won't get mine.
Ruth.
Give it to him!
That's an order, Ruth.
Sir...
Give it him, Ruth.
Yes, sir.
Echo-Mike... 6-0-2-8... 5, sir.
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Sir, NORAD reports that the second Cerberus code has been entered.
My God.
- Mike!
Mike, Mike, it's me.
-Dave?
You scared the shit out of me.
Jesus, what the fuck?
Yeah, just put that thing down.
I almost blew your fucking brains out, man.
What are you doing here?
I was with the South Korean delegation.
What the fuck are you doing here?
I thought you were working at the Treasury.
Yeah, I am.
Believe it or not, I came in through the front door.
Oh, fuck, Mike.
I saw my life flash in front of me.
Look at my hand.
Fucker's shakin'.
Jesus Christ.
It's good to see you, buddy.
You got a funny way of showing it.
Is the president okay?
He's alive for now.
They got him in the bunker.
It's a fucking shit show, huh?
Yeah, that's for sure.
Roma make it?
Fuck.
We gotta keep movin'.
- You got a plan, Mike?
-Yeah.
But it hasn't worked out so far.
Fuckin' Mike.
You always were a hardass.
You never change.
Hey, Dave.
This place is getting me rattled, man.
I can't think straight.
You okay?
No. Not for real.
This fucking Kang, man.
He's crazy.
How do you know his name?
Hey, Mike, do you remember that time in New York?
Dave.
Why'd you do it?
Fuck, Mike.
Fuck.
I lost my way.
You can make up for it now.
Tell Kang I'm dead.
You'll help me save the president.
Kang.
It's Forbes.
I got him.
All clear.
Good.
Ruth.
Mr. President, sir?
Rough day.
Could be worse.
How's my hair?
Not a strand out of place.
Any regrets?
None.
You?
A few.
Like running for president.
The office is lucky to have you, sir.
We all may meet our maker today... but the one thing I do not want on my tombstone...
"She Went Down Without a Fight."
No danger of that.
Pull up your satellite feed.
Give me eyes on.
Looks like there's only four sentries on the roof.
With the Air Defense grid gone, they're vulnerable to an aerial insertion.
Wait.
Let me get there first and check it out.
We're not waiting.
We have to secure Cerberus.
Oh, fuck.
Send in the SEALS, General.
We're going through the roof.
Command, Tiger Flight inbound.
Tiger Team, stand by.
The assault team is on the way.
About fucking time.
Yes, sir.
Copy.
Command, Tiger Flight's three minutes out.
Team, go green.
Go green.
Cho.
60 seconds to target.
I want a clean deployment.
Fuck.
Tell them to hold.
We aren't holding shit!
Jacobs.
You've gotta abort his mission.
They've got the Hydra Six!
What's that?
Next generation weaponry.
Ours.
How the hell would they get that?
It doesn't matter.
We'll take it out.
I said abort this fucking mission!
Let's go get our goddamn house back, Captain.
Tiger Two, Tiger Three, you're cleared hot.
Tiger Two, roger.
Tiger Three, roger.
All birds, be on the lookout for possible advanced weaponry.
Approaching rooftop.
Negative on the four sentries.
Tiger Flight's on station.
We got 'em.
Go, go, go!
Fast ropes deployed.
We have a radar locked sourced from target.
Tiger Two's taking fire from the rooftop!
Tiger Team, go combat flight.
Tiger Two's hit.He's going down.
Tiger Two going down hard.
Tiger Two's hit.
Evasive, evasive.
Take out that target.
Concentrate fire on that rooftop.
Tiger Three, fly behind the target.
Tiger Four, adjust approach!
Head northwest and flank from there!
Tiger Five and Six, switch to Formation Charlie and take out that gun!
Damn it, drop altitude!
Tiger One gunner just got hit!
Watch your three.
Watch your three.
Taking fire.
- Hold on!
-We're getting hit!
Tiger Six is down!
Tiger Five taking...
Tiger Five's gone down.
Reset formation.
Tiger One taking lead.
Roger that.
We need backup!
They're chewing us up!
Engaging Target.
Provide cover.
All remaining Blackhawks, provide air cover.
Two birds up.
Only two birds remain.
Abort!
Abort!
Pull out.
Clear the area.
Roger!
Clearing the area!
Tiger One is hit!
Losing control!
Tail rotor failure.
Mayday, mayday!
We're going down!
Five out of six birds are down.
Requesting QRT.
Permission to launch second squadron.
Negative, negative.
We don't have any intel about what other surprises they could have for us.
Return to base.
Return to base.
Over.
Roger that.
Banning, are you there?
Banning!
Half the White House is just gone.
The residence, the roof, all destroyed... and the remainder of the historic building now trashed.
Speaker Trumbull, that was a very foolish undertaking.
Your president is next.
You now have one hour to recall the Seventh Fleet and your troops.
Once you do so, I want a helicopter on the North Lawn fueled and ready.
60 minutes.
Fuck.
It's Banning.
Patch him through.
- Mike?
-Yeah.
We've been trying to reach you, son.
Are you okay?
Mr. Speaker, sir, if we ever get out of this shit storm... you can hold me for insubordination.
But your team needs some serious fucking help.
This is General Clegg, Army Chief of Staff.
I am ordering you to stand down.
Remove your only eyes and ears from the ground.
That's fucking brilliant.
We need to pull you out of there before we lose another hostage!
I am giving you a direct order.
Newsflash, asshole.
I don't work for you.
General Clegg.
I'm the Commander-in-Chief.
If I didn't absolutely need you, I would relieve you right now.
I will not let this asshole
- I don't wanna here another word... out of you unless I ask you a question!
- Blow up America, sir!
Sir.
Mr. Banning.
Mr. Banning, are you there?
Yes, sir.
What's the plan?
We're recalling the Seventh Fleet pulling our troops back from the DMZ and giving them the helicopter.
Sir, you cannot do that.
You cannot give this guy what he wants.
I've dealt with these types of men before.
Give me some time.
Let me flush him out.
We are talking about the safety of the President of the United States!
We're talking about a hell of a lot more than that, sir.
With all due respect, you're acting president now.
And I'm the best hope you've got.
Okay, Mike.You've got 30 minutes.
Leah, call for you on the landline.
The emergency line.
Can you make sure he gets some morphine?
Yes.
Mike?
Hey.
I was just checking in.
Babe. How's your day been?
Yeah, it's been busy.
It's good, you know.
How 'bout you?
Yeah.Busy.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I just, I've, I've had to stay a little later than I expected.
Yeah, me too.
You're gonna come home tonight, right?
Yeah.
Sure.
We got a date, remember?
Hey, I gotta go.
You know, this, uh, paperwork's piling up.
Okay.
I love you.
What's the matter, Kang?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
I guess you don't know who you can trust, huh?
It's over.
No more televised executions.
No chopper.
No more negotiating with you and the United People's Front of Who Gives a Fuck.
I will send the president out... one piece at a time.
It won't matter.
Because whatever you think you accomplished you won't be alive to see it.
Shut him down.
Ah, you're not shutting me down, Kang.
I'm here to stay.
I underestimated you.
It will not happen again.
There is no again.
You're gonna die down there alone cut off from the rest of the world.
My advice?
Save the last bullet for yourself.
'Cause if you don't...
I'm gonna stick my knife through your brain.
But don't worry.
I'm gonna leak the photos of your body to the press.
You know, 'cause I know you like that kind of shit.
Her!
I pledge allegiance to the flag... of the United States of America!
Your leader is out of his mind.
You fucking idiot!
Go.
Walk.
Move!
Sir, there's movement in front of the White House.
Ours or theirs?
Looks like Secretary McMillan, sir.
- Any bulges, wires?
-Negative.
Sir, ground reports activity at the White House.
- Is that?
-McMillan.
Get a team out there now.
And another to cover!
Go!
It looks like Secretary McMillan.
Yeah, yes, it is.
Yes!
Mike?
Hey.
He got away.
He's back in the bunker.
You gave it a good shot, Mike.
You saved McMillan.
North and South Korean military forces are on high alert in response to rumors of an impending American pull-out from the DMZ.
India, China and Russia have declared a state of emergency and have mobilized military forces.
In the Middle East though, the response to the attack on the White House is jubilant.
Crowds of thousands are celebrating in the streets and American flags are burning.
...created by a U.S. departure could spark an immediate and full-scale conflict and that any conventional war in this heavily-armed corner of the world could easily escalate into nuclear confrontation.
The hour's up.
Send the helicopter.
Le's recall the Seventh Fleet.
Pull the troops out of the DMZ.
We just lost South Korea.
Our Pentagon sources are now saying that U.S. ground troops have been given the order to withdraw from Korea for the first time in 60 years.
We're also hearing reports that the U.S.'s Seventh Fleet has been directed to pull back in the region.
Although unconfirmed, this historic turn of events seems to be motivated by today's attack on the White House which began as the Prime Minister of Korea was meeting with President Asher.
What are they doing?
Mike.
We have to get Kang and the president out in the open and take out our best shot.
Copy that, sir.
Bravo Team is in position.
Sir, we are ready.
All units are in position.
Here come the hostages.
We count 11 targets, sir.
One of them's gotta be the president.
That's their ticket out.
Hercules Six in position.
Can you I.D. the president?
Negative.
Can you I.D. Kang?
Negative.
Targets unclear.
Sir, all ground units are in position.
Do we have the go-ahead to take them?
If we're gonna go, we gotta go now, sir.
Do we have the go-ahead, sir?
No. Too risky.
They could kill the president.
Yes, sir.
It's okay.
We have a tracking device on the chopper.
Holy shit.
What was that?
Was that us?
Negative, negative.
That wasn't us.
Though it is not confirmed yet, President Asher is believed to have been among those killed when the Blackhawk helicopter went down in flames on the White House North Lawn.
And certainly, today's events will be recorded in history
-as one of this country's darkest hours.
- Oh, my God.
The president's gone.
Mike?
What the hell just happened?
I'm sorry to report... the president was on that helicopter.
And Kang?
Kang killed himself.
And all the other hostages.
Wait.
This doesn't add up.
It doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense?
Kang would not go out like that, sir.
That's not who he is.
I think he's still in the bunker.
And he has the president.
He's gonna try and slip away.
If Kang is still on the premises with the president, you can't let him leave.
He won't.
Huh?
Who the hell does that?
Enough!
I read your Bible, Mr. President.
It says, the wages of sin is death.
You better keep that in mind.
What are you doing?
Cerberus has been activated.
We haven't launched any missiles yet.
I don't need to launch them.
The explosive force within each hardened silo will detonate the missiles.
Tens of millions of Americans will perish.
Your country will be a cold, dark nuclear wasteland.
Now, too, America shall know suffering and famine.
South Korean officials are saying now that they've pulled out the reserves and they're mobilizing additional armored units in response...
Sir?
Cerberus has been activated.
- What?
-NORAD confirms.
How did it come to this?
We lost Korea and now our nukes?
- They couldn't have broken the code.
- That would be impossible.
They'd be on the bunker computer for days to break three codes.
No, he only need to break one code.
But we haven't launched any missiles.
They're gonna detonate them in their silos.
How many?
All of 'em.
He's just opened the gates of hell.
Time to go, Mr. President!
You really think you're gonna get out of here alive?
The world thinks we're both dead.
And with you as insurance...
Come on, Mike.
Looks like you failed again, Mike.
Sir?
Sir, sir, look at me.
Sir...
Sir.
Okay.
It's gone through and you've lost a little blood.
But I'm gonna get you outta here, okay?
Now, you know what to do.
Ben, Ben, come on!
- Cerberus.
-What?
Cerberus activated.
Cerberus.
Keep that pressed in.
Sir!
Ben!
You're gonna be okay.
All right.
This is Banning.
I have the president.
He's hurt, but alive.
How do I switch this fucking thing off?
- Hang on.
-Deactivation code!
Find a control panel marked, "Countermand."
Countermand.
Got it!
Flip a blue-white switch marked, "initiate Recall."
Initiate recall.
Okay.
Deactivation sequence initiated.
Please enter abort command.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
November.
India. Lima.
- Wait, wait.
Yep. -5-Oscar-Hotel.
- Oscar, Hotel.
-Backslash.
Niner.
- Backslash.
-Victor.
Kilo.
- Hash-tag.
-What?
- Hash-tag.
-Shift 3!
Okay, fuck!
- Shift 3!
-Echo.
Sierra.
- Foxtrot.
-Foxtrot.
Is that it?
That's it.
Cerberus has been deactivated.
Sir.
NORAD confirms...
Cerberus has been shut down.
Good.
Now get me Seoul and Pyongyang on the line.
Are you ready, Mr. President?
All right.
Sorry about the house, sir.
It's okay.
I believe it's insured.
We've lost good friends.
Family.
All good people.
- Heroes, every one of them.
-Dad!
Our hearts and prayers go out to their families.
And they will be remembered.
Nor will we forget... those who serve out of the spotlight to whom we owe our highest gratitude.
Our foe did not come only to destroy our things or our people.
They came to desecrate a way of life.
To foul our beliefs, trample our freedom.
And in this, not only did they fail... they granted us the greatest gift.
A chance at our rebirth.
We will rise.
Renewed.
Stronger and united.
This is our time... our chance to get back to the best of who we are.
To lead by example with the dignity, integrity and honor that built this country and which will build it once again.
May God bless you.
And may God bless the United States of America.
The truth is, on Wall Street a lot of people just weren't very good at their jobs.
It started out 16 months ago as a mortgage crisis and it slowly evolved into a credit crisis.
We ask about the taxpayers being on the hook, guess what?
an unusual step for a lame duck president, but the country...
Trying to be free market advocate when it's really an "anything goes" mentality.
On Friday, Congress finally passed and President Bush signed into law...
Begin to restore strength and stability will buy out Wall Street's bad investments.
A full-blown financial storm.
In just 6 months, 3 of the 5 biggest independent firms on Wall Street have now disappeared.
numbers are staggering they don't begin to explain the greed and incompetence that created this mess.
No regulation, no supervision, no discipline.
Terrible debt that was gnified by reckless borrowing and complex securities.
The idea that you could lend money to someone who could not pay it back is not an inherently attractive idea.
I don't know why this company's coming to Congress.
However it seemed to fly with people who were making
$10 million a year.
They think they can take that money and do whatever they wanna do.
They decide to punish the country.
Neel Kashkari, the man in charge of the bailout.
We're supposed to be with the smartest investors in the world and they did it themselves.
I would call it criminal neglect and incompetence.
They're certainly not worth it.
Instead of helping consumers with mortgages and loans.
People at the top of these firms chose to look away, to take more risk to enrich themselves and it is truly a crime.
What's our risk?
12 billion.
But we have a real situation here, our clients are about to jump ship.
The problem is saving this company, not the clients.
This company!
We shifted 4 billion into deposits, which leaves us with 8.
But that move only buys us a few more weeks, at best.
I talked to Meryl, they said they'd ensure the paper for two weeks but they want 200 million to do it.
Two weeks is nothing, we need two months at least.
No, it's time for triage.
It's time to dump the certificates on the market, all of them.
What about the pension fund investors?
We're talking over 15 billion.
But if other houses follow suit,
Our priority is saving this house and fuck all the others!
Our responsibility begins and ends with our partners and our shareholders and that's it.
Investors gamble, they lose, that's the risk that they agreed to take.
why should they complain when they lose money on the market?
Shit happens, now dump it!
Dump it all right fucking now!
Even after we dump the stocks we're still far too exposed and we've got no parachute here.
I'm gonna take care of that.
Charlotte?
with the secretary of treasury?
Will do.
Today.
Understood sir, today.
Thanks.
You heard Stancroft, the entire company's in jeopardy.
Yeah, with 51 million in his pocket... and you know as well as I do, this is bullshit.
This is Stancroft and his fucking pissing contest with his goddamn pluggers.
but we don't really have a choice, do we?
All right people, listen up!
All right, I've got some great news for you guys.
In the next three days we are gonna increase your incentives by 3 percent.
But I need you to get on the horn and get all your top clients and really push the real estate growth superfund.
As well, you will be receiving a memo in the next couple minutes detailing all the products that we need you guys to unload.
Whoever sells the most gets the largest bonus.
All right, let's go people!
Move it!
Get those numbers!
Sell, sell!
Hey girl.
Hey boy.
The good news, as we can see here, is that the tumors are completely gone.
That's the good news.
Not bad news, just simply less than good news.
which is why we're seeing a recurrence of your symptoms.
But you got everything, right?
Yes, we see this on occasion.
Hormone injections once a week, that's the first thing.
It's a tricky balancing act, we'll have to monitor your levels until we find the right mix.
Also, your blood sugar level has sky rocketed.
Again, as a result of the gland's reaction to the tumor, so we'll have to treat you for diabetes.
But she's going to be all right?
Oh yes, we just have a bit more ways to get you there, that's all.
What about, um... we were...
We were planning on getting pregnant before the diagnosis.
At this particular time, it would be an extremely high-risk pregnancy, both for you and the baby.
but once we get you to acceptable levels with treatment, which lowers the risk, then by all means yes.
There's a new gene therapy that certain patients have responded well to, which could get us to normalcy faster.
It's a little on the experimental side,
Sign us up, doc.
Yeah.
Excellent!
I know it's difficult but try hard to relax and not to worry, it only adds stress to your system.
Thank you.
Thanks doc.
You're welcome.
It seems as if your coverage cap limit has been reached.
Coverage cap limit, what's that?
It's standard among many insurers, you really should call them.
But regarding today, we'll need payment
Oh, okay... well we can call in later to reschedule, we'll talk.
No, no, no... fine, we'll uh... we'll use the card.
I'm sure it's some kind of mistake.
If I can get my wallet out of my pocket... there you go.
There.
Are you sure you wanna use the card?
Am I sure?
Not really.
Just call them.
So, should we keep next Tuesday then?
Yeah, why don't you just call in and we can...
Okay.
Thank you!
Thanks.
Thank you!
Bye.
Thanks.
Coverage cap?
This is the first time it's ever been mentioned to me.
Now listen, I'm on the phone to you guys at least a hundred times this year... someone should've said something.
Sir, it's clearly stated in the...
I've been buried in a metric ton of paperwork from you guys
Now, I can't be expected to catch every line of fine print from every letter.
I work 6, 7 days a week.
It's company policy, sir...
I get that it's company policy but that's got nothing to do...
I'm sorry, there's nothing more we can do for you at this point.
So what you're saying is go fuck yourself, have a nice day.
I sincerely doubt you're at all apologetic.
You're not supposed to be, right?
Mr. Baxford, I'm very sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, baby...
Jim, it's just... it's useless.
Don't say that.
It is, I mean, I'm just...
I'm stuck here and I can't work and I'm sick all the time, and you've been working so hard...
I'm working for us.
Jim, I read the invoice and hormone treatments, they cost $300 a shot.
That's on top of all the other medication and then the gene therapy, they could be anywhere from
50,000 to 70,000, and if the insurance doesn't cover it...
I'm not, I can't let you spend our whole life savings.
Stop, stop!
Stop.
Listen to me, we need the treatments, you need to get well.
Once we get well we can have our baby and live the life we wanna live, okay?
Okay, good night.
Good night.
Hey girl.
Hey boy.
What's it look like I'm doing?
Hey... we're not supposed to get pregnant yet.
We can practice.
Yeah...
Yeah?
Jim, I love you so much.
Dude, that sucks!
There's an actual coverage cap on the insurance, that means that there's really literally like, a limit to how much you can spend on Rosie per month for her medical?
it says if you get too sick and it's too expensive, they stop fucking paying.
I was planning on having by the time I was 60.
I guess if I get sick I'd be better off swallowing my own gun.
Rosie's worried out of her fucking mind.
So what are you gonna do?
I got some money tucked away, army disability, stuff like that.
I'll call my broker.
I hear the market's shit right now man, what are you invested in?
Structured notes, whatever's safest.
Fuck, I hope so bro.
I'll call in the lunch.
Fuck.
I'm not making enough.
What up you lazy bastards?
What'd you do, just roll out of bed?
It's Jim Baxford.
No, no... second shift.
Lunch for you, breakfast for us.
Just sit down and shut up, we already ordered for you.
Tom gets the cheeseburger, Jim... chili.
Cold chili, and he's always surprised, you know?
But he always finishes.
Give me a couple of days, call the office.
Oh uh, what's going on with my funds?
Uh...
Jim, look I really gotta...
I'm in a...
I'll talk to you in a couple days...
Hello?
That's what he meant, that's what he was thinking about.
Fucking hell.
Hey man.
Fucking asshole.
My broker, phone keeps dropping out.
Everybody's cheesed about their broker these days.
Frank and me just learned that we have lost 20 percent of our pension.
Gone, like watery piss in the wind.
I don't know, bad investments on the part of idiots like us.
to some of those administration meetings.
Those meetings are bullshit!
Our administrators only do what's good for them, no matter how many people go to those goddamn meetings, they should call it collective ball scratching.
You know what me and Freddy do with our day?
We bust homeless people for sleeping in the park, or uh... we bust some stupid shmuck for jaywalking, but the real fucking criminals, they're downtown on Wall Street, wearing suits that cost more than any of us make in a year.
And those mother fuckers steal more money than any asshole on Riker's Island ever dreamed of stealing, and if they get caught, which they won't get caught, but if they did they'd get an ankle bracelet
and put under house arrest.
In their mansions where the hookers come to you.
Yeah and they spend the night.
Well the expensive kind of hookers that you want to spend the night,
Wall Street hookers.
Wall Street... pow, pow!
Fuck those guys you know what I mean, fuck them.
Yeah, you guys are doing a real good job of cheering my buddy up over here.
Oh, we're just talking shit, Jim.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Hey fellas, the usual?
I didn't order fries, that's his.
All around.
Beef for you.
Where's my chili?
It's coming!
My fucking chili.
Make sure it's warm.
It's freezing cold.
Great.
I don't know why we come here, the food sucks.
But the site's good.
At least it's warm.
That's true.
How's Rosie doing, Jim?
She's hanging in there.
It's been a tough year, you know?
She's a fighter.
Give her our best.
Yeah.
She's a trooper that one, Rosie.
She's a good girl.
How's your wife?
Great.
She's cheating on me.
What?
If you guys need anything else, just give me a holler.
What happened?
I'm a cop, I got married, it's inevitable.
It is.
How did you find out?
I read her text messages.
Erotic reading, let me tell you.
Well what are you gonna do?
whoever he is, or to thank him from the bottom of my heart for keeping her occupied and off my back.
It's a real conundrum here.
Now, can we just talk about something else, huh?
Talk about his girlfriend.
Who, yours?
I heard on the news and they were talking about who you'd wanna have sex with, right?
A., your wife or B., before he could even answer, she could... blah!
I fucked it up.
Husband and wife are laying in bed... the wife says to the husband, "listen, when I die would you get another woman in my bed?"
He says, "uh... yeah."
She says "uh, well will you marry her?", he says "well, maybe".
She says, "will you let her use my golf clubs?", he says "no!
She's left handed".
You guys wonder why you're divorced,
Hey, you know you did it right Jim, you didn't marry a cop's wife.
You married a girl you actually love.
Yeah, I hear that.
She's a keeper that Rosie, for sure.
Cheers to you guys.
Cheers.
Jim and Rosie.
Simon Johnson, could you highlight for our viewers the plutocratic capturing of American politics?
Well there are several examples...
Robert Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs serves as treasury secretary under Clinton, and when he leaves he becomes chairman
John Snow, secretary of treasury under Bush, leaves to become chairman of Cerberus Capital Management, a very large private equity firm that also has Dan Quayle
Allan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve leaves to become a consultant...
Hey girl.
Hey boy.
How you feeling?
A little better.
Good.
Mostly responsible for deregulating financial derivatives and then proceeds to make millions of dollars in hedge funds that invest in those very same derivatives that he deregulated.
Henry Paulson, CEO of Goldman Sachs leaves Goldman Sachs to join the Bush government as secretary of treasury with a 50 million dollar...
I have a treatment tomorrow, can you make it?
Absolutely.
And about the payment, uh...
Babe, we gotta use the cards until we can get this thing fixed.
Jim, they just raised the interest rate on the cards and I've already put some bills on there, so...
Babe, it's all right.
Well it's just you've been working so hard lately, and...
I know, I know... what choice do we have?
I'm doing this for us.
Okay.
You coming to bed?
In a minute.
All right.
Chris Dodd, chairman of the banking committee in the Senate, collected 13 million in campaign funds.
Apparently...
Ahh... ahh!
Ouch...
All right, see you next week.
Let's get outta here.
Jim...
What the hell's going on?
but your note's been d-listed from the exchange.
D-listed, what does that mean?
There's an investigation going on right now.
Into what?
An investigation into some investment portfolios.
It looks like a significant portion of your fund was diverted into paper that is, well... a little suspect.
Meaning, you don't know...
No, no I don't.
No one knows right now.
You're my broker, it's what you do.
How could you put my money into anything suspicious?
I only invest in clean deals but it seems the firm itself is behind all this.
Look, I can't really tell you anything else.
This thing is a legal snowball.
Look, we'll just have to wait until the investigation is through but it...
I mean it seems that your investment was good and as it should be but then everything lost its value.
The question is did the firm have knowledge that your original investment was bad?
You just said you only deal in clean deals.
I do.
I do but I'm the player here, okay?
Not the whole game.
You're not the only one hurting because of this.
the investments of a lot of unfortunate people...
Unfortunate? !
Unfortunate people?
You told me, you promised me
I'd make 8 to 10 percent of my investment, guaranteed.
Yeah, and that is what my firm told me.
I searched it out, I did my research, my office manager told me to put my clients into this.
What else did you put the money in to?
Notes backed by commercial real estate.
I mean look, these looked like great buildings...
I checked the specs, I did the research, they looked like they'd be at full capacity, okay?
Did you, did you inspect these buildings?
Did you inspect these properties?
The people that do all the research told me that this was the real deal.
So what do we do now?
We'll get some information regarding the investigation and...
look, I'm telling you it's gonna take a while though, before this whole thing is clear.
You're telling me I've lost all my money.
No, not necessarily.
There's gonna be some large lawsuits.
I just want my money back.
Jim, that's not how investment works.
I mean, you gotta pay to play.
This is not a fucking game to me, this is my fucking life savings to me, you fuck.
Look, I understand.
Hey, I feel your pain, I do.
I lost a lot of money too.
But that's how investment works, man.
I'm sorry.
It gives and it takes away.
Yeah, how are we doing with these sales?
We're at 20 percent.
I totally agree but the price is falling.
Oh, Jesus.
The price is falling to where, nothing?
but our clients are starting to question our credibility.
Well that's good, some things never change.
All right, you keep me posted.
Rosie?
Sorry I'm late, I had to cover for one of the guys at work.
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
You know you can tell me, you know.
I know.
The bank called.
They did?
What'd they say?
I don't know, the machine picked it up.
The message said they needed you to call or get down there as soon as possible.
Our mortgage, our interest rate, something like that.
I mean, I was gonna call...
I'll take care of the bank.
I'll call them tomorrow.
And there's this.
It's from my broker.
Jim... what's going on?
Baby, nothing's going on.
Please, you gotta stop worrying.
Let me take care of the small stuff, all right?
You need to get well.
Okay, I'm gonna go draw a bath, play some music, light some candles.
Light some candles?
Yeah, you should join me.
All right.
Okay.
Jim, I don't know what to tell you.
You're the one who said put my money in bullshit real estate.
It says right here that I am now liable for another 60 grand.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Jim, I told you, no one saw this coming.
I'm gonna sue you.
Okay just calm down, we'll get to the bottom of this.
I need you to cover me for a couple days.
No worries, man.
More problems?
Yeah, something's come up.
No she's fine, I've gotta take care of a few things.
Okay, take care buddy.
All right.
I'll file a lawsuit, simple.
So I won't have to pay the 60 grand?
I'll make sure you don't have to pay the 60,000 or any of the interest they're laying on top of that, but... your original investment, you'll have to talk to the ADA about that.
I think... your ma would join that case.
Better fucking bet your life I will.
Now then, I work on a retainer basis so I'll need 10 thousand dollars in advance to file a civil complaint.
10 grand, I ain't got 10 grand.
No problem, lots of lawyers work for cheap.
Look Jim, I'm not dealing with your investment.
It looks like there has been a crime, and the DA's office is dealing with that.
Now if this is true, I'd be happy to assist you if you decide to sue for damages.
But we have to start by filing this complaint for injunctive relief to protect you from the 60,000 demand and the interest it's going to accumulate.
I'm sorry Jim, but I'm looking at over 40 hours of work on your case.
Come back when you've got the 10 grand, that's my minimum.
You can borrow the money or get a credit card but that's the best I can do.
Somewhat ironically I'm like investing.
With attorneys, you usually get what you pay for.
I'll see what I can do.
Call me!
Or not...
You all right?
Yeah, hanging in there.
Hey, is that back door supposed to be open?
How you been man?
Hey, what's up man?
Any hold up today?
Same old shit, different day.
they expect you to pay 60 grand now?
It's happening all over, I lost 18,000 in a mutual fund, college money for my son.
Yeah, my folks lost their nest egg.
I'm fucked.
Why, you don't have $60,000?
What do you fucking think?
You got family you could borrow from?
Not an option.
but I could scratch up a few bucks.
Yeah, we could take up a collection with the guys.
Guys, guys...
I'm just gonna refuse to pay it.
We gotta get to the job.
Lunch is on me, all right?
Allow me.
Thanks guys, I appreciate it.
Look, hang in there.
It can only get better.
Yeah.
Change?
It's for you, sweetie.
Thanks.
Later.
Jim...
I got uh... 10 grand I can loan you.
Please Jim, listen to me man.
Sean, forget about it.
Look, I don't have a girlfriend, I don't have a family,
I don't have anything...
okay?
Please, let me help you out, it would mean a lot to me.
I might take you up on that, pay this lawyer.
Just hang in there.
It's called an adjustable rate for a reason, when the housing market changes... so do the interest rates, that's how that works.
Listen, uh... my premiums have doubled in the blink of an eye,
I'm not gonna be able to keep up at this rate.
Yeah, you got a favourable deal when you signed.
The terms of which was that a specified point in time the interest rate would reflect the market.
Can we refinance?
Well your net worth has taken a significant hit over the last few days and your wife, she hasn't worked for a year or so, right?
Yeah, she got sick.
But in light of all of that, refinancing wouldn't be prudent for our bank at this time.
So you're shafting me?
No, no... it's not me, it's the guidelines handed down from above.
If it were up to me, I would help you out.
Uh, you could always try to sell your house.
I can't sell my house is this market.
I'm sorry, I don't know what else to tell you.
You could declare bankruptcy, a lot of people do that.
Fuck you.
That's a fair response, I suppose.
Hey!
Hey.
You at the bank?
Yeah.
Well what was it about?
Like I said, don't worry about it.
All right?
Mmmhmm.
Good.
Ahh...
I knew you'd have no problems coming up with this.
I got it from a friend.
It will and then I'll see if I can find other investors who got burned on this and put together a collective lawsuit.
Collective ball scratching.
What's that?
It's just a joke.
Not funny, I guess.
Don't underestimate the power of a large group when it comes to asking for damages.
I hope so.
So what do I do about this letter demanding 60 grand?
I'll contact the other party,
I will let them know I am your attorney and that you will not be paying.
You know, there may be another way out of this.
You take the fall on this but it could end all this drama for you instantly.
Would you be willing to write off your initial investment and walk away if these guys let you out of the 60,000?
It's something you should consider.
It could be years before the real estate market bounces back.
If for some reason I can get the court to grant injunctive relief to stop these guys, years of interest on this claim against you.
This motion, it's gonna work right?
Most likely, but nothing in law is for certain.
I'm just offering this as an option but if they're willing to let you play ball and back off, then you can put it all behind you.
It'd be nice, huh?
Okay, don't think about it for too long, the time to act is now.
You just paid me, I can either file the complaint as planned or I can try and negotiate directly with them but I need to do one or the other.
I need a day.
Half a day would be better.
All right, I uh...
I got a meeting with the assistant district attorney today.
Oh yeah, good.
I'll put that in the letter.
Thanks.
Let me know what happens.
I'm sure I double checked the schedule when you called doesn't have time in his schedule for you today.
I'm sorry, I can leave him a message if you'd like.
Well um, maybe you can answer a few questions for me.
I'm afraid that I wouldn't be any help with anything.
I'm not even a legal secretary, I'm just an assistant.
Just the assistant, that's your excuse?
Do you have any idea what's going on here?
Have you heard of my name at all?
No, I'm sorry sir.
No, I don't.
You haven't.
Myra, coffee please.
I need to speak to you.
Mr. Marwood!
Mr. Marwood is very busy.
Please, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I need to speak to him.
Don't make me have to call security.
I am security, you fucking bitch.
Get your fucking hands off me.
So... how did it go today?
The bastard didn't have time for me.
You had an appointment, man.
Yeah.
You gonna be okay?
You have reached the voicemail of Patterson Law Group, please leave a message after the tone.
These bastards, they never answer their fucking phones.
Hey uh... about the money, seriously... don't even worry about paying me back.
It ain't no thing but a chicken wing, man.
I appreciate that.
I've done everything, I went to the DA,
I went to the lawyer...
fucking banks.
The system's rigged motherfucker!
Come on, you know that shit.
Yeah.
Yeah it is.
Let's go get some alcohol, make the pain go away.
Perhaps the best example of how this all works is in the AIG bailout.
When AIG went bankrupt...
Listen lady, I've left him a ton of messages, a ton.
He's the guy in charge of prosecuting the brokerage houses, right?
Yes, that's one of many cases.
Well I need to speak to him urgently, like right now.
100 cents on the dollar was paid to the Goldman Sachs debtors.
When a firm goes bankrupt you don't expect to get a hundred percent of those dollars because it's a bankrupt firm, it can't pay its debts.
Thank you.
You can expect to get maybe 50 cents on the dollar, but no... the American taxpayer pays Goldman Sachs
100 cents on the dollar and all those... were also secretary of the treasury.
The occupy Wall Street protests, a few thousand people, I do not understand why the American people are not up in arms about this.
These are criminal acts, this is blatant fraud and conflict of interest.
There's no government investigation, charges have been laid, one's even looking into it!
And yet all the information is there in the open to see.
These are criminals walking in our midst.
And now the banks want the same piece of faith that we have in our government.
The banks have been trading with ideas, they just have derivatives and swaps that move back and forth.
This has to stop, this can't go on.
We have to underpin our dealings with actual wealth, not pieces of paper that are simply ideas from rich men.
Hey baby.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
You got treatment this morning, right?
I know, I cancelled it.
Our cards, they declined last time and the... the debt people, they've been calling the house, so I called the bank and...
I know what's going on.
We're broke, aren't we?
We had all of our money in that fund and it's... it's gone, isn't it?
Jim...
Jim, it's okay.
I understand, you... you were just protecting me.
It'll be okay.
I'm gonna get the money back, I'm gonna fix this.
Oh God, this has been so hard on you.
You're getting gray hair and wrinkles all because of me.
It's gonna be all right, you're gonna be all right.
No, I'm not.
But it's okay.
I just, I really...
I wanted us to have a baby.
You know I know that he would look just like you and I couldn't wish for anything more.
Baby, don't say that.
We're gonna sell the house...
Jim...
It'll be okay, it's...
I'm calling my lawyer.
Uh, Jim Baxford for Mr. Patterson.
One moment please.
I uh, I got a letter here saying they're gonna foreclose on us and uh, the bank's cutting us off all because of this bullshit real estate.
You offered to waive my investment if I knocked off the 60 grand.
but you didn't give me an answer in time.
If I could've gotten to them earlier...
I called you back the same fucking day.
At the end of a long Friday after 4 PM, if I remember correctly.
That means I didn't get back to them until Monday or Tuesday,
What about this motion you filed, the relief thing?
The broker you invested with went bankrupt their assets were purchasd by another company, there's no one to file a motion against right now since the broker's in bankruptcy you need to hire a bankruptcy attorney to lift a thing called an automatic stay,
which really is a pain in the ass.
What about the real estate company, what about that?
Well they're also under the protection of bankruptcy court
It's part of the bankruptcy law that says you can't take any action against a company in bankruptcy without first hiring another lawyer and getting permission from the bankruptcy court.
It's complicated!
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Why'd I fucking hire you?
I haven't heard from you in 2 weeks and certainly wasn't privy to the inner financial workings
The bankruptcy filings were just as much a surprise to me.
So let me give you my best advice... pay the 60 grand,
I'll file the same injunctive relief motion we talked about to try and prevent you from having to pay and I won't ask your for any more money from you for me.
How's that sound?
I don't have 60 grand.
Jim, I'll get this one.
Call me later...
This is all my fault.
No, I got sick and I put us in debt.
It's not your fault, it's the banks, the CEO's,
Jim, I just...
I hate what this is doing to you.
I'm sorry.
I gotta go to work.
Jim...
Jim...
Andy, you wanted to see me?
Yeah, come on in.
Close the door please.
Jim... we've been contacted by a couple of lawyers and collection agencies in the last couple of days... it seems that you have a lot of debts...
It's not what you think.
They've got a judgment against you, a lien to garnish your wages on a monthly basis.
How much?
You keep 800 per month.
Right, um...
let me speak to my lawyer before you give these guys anything.
Jim, I'm sorry but we're gonna have to let you go.
We cannot have employees that are having financial troubles protecting our money.
You get what I mean?
We're a bonded firm, we'll lose our insurance, we'll lose our clients... we just can't have you working here, not under these conditions.
Think of how it looks, and it's not good.
Severance...
What about my insurance?
You can do COBRA on the insurance.
That's 600 a month, how can I keep her alive on that?
The check is your official severance, but we owe you back pay, overtime... you put in a lot of hours and you've been a loyal employee, so instead of a check I had them issue it in cash.
It's a bit of a bump, 9,000.
Cash is better, I figure banks and collections will never know, just between us.
I appreciate that.
And I'm gonna need your weapon and employee ID too.
Jim... hey man, listen...
I'm sorry, I didn't know!
I can't answer the phone right now, just leave a message.
Have a good day.
Hey Jim what's up, it's Sean.
Look, I didn't know it was gonna happen, all right?
I'm really sorry.
I love you bro, please give me a call.
Rosie?
Rosie?
Rosie?
Rosie...
Baby...
Baby?
Oh my God, baby...
Oh my God, oh no...
Rosie?
Rosie... 911...
Rosie, Rosie...
God visits us with many mysteries in life, unexpected death is the most challenging.
when God leaves us speechless in the face of death, he reminds us all we have is forgiveness.
We must set our anger aside and look to those whom we have lost, to found a better life.
For who is God, except the lord, and who is a rock besides our God?
The god who girdles me with strength and made my way safe.
He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.
He trains my hands for war so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze, you have given me the shield of your salvation and your right hand has supported me.
Your help has made me great, you gave me a wide place for my steps under me and my feet did not slip.
I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back until they were consumed.
I struck them down so that they were not able to rise, they fell under my feet for you girdled me with strength for the battle.
You made my assailants sink under me, you made my enemies turn their backs to me and those who hated me, I destroyed.
Hey, you've got Jim and Rosie.
We're not home right now but leave a message and we'll call you right back.
Hey Jim, it's Sean.
Uh, you're not answering your cell, are you all right?
I don't really know what to say but uh, I'm just thinking of you bro. I hope you're okay, I love you.
Please call.
Hey, you've got Jim and Rosie.
We're not home right now but leave a message and we'll call you right back.
Hey Jim, it's Fred and Frank.
Listen bud, we'd love to get together for lunch sometime.
We'll come over some night, watch the game, do some serious drinking.
We miss you, pal.
Well done, well done!
Thank you to my lovely secretary who's been working so hard.
I think after last week...
Mr. Marwood is extremely busy!
It's lovely!
Well maybe it's time for some of us to stumble home.
Have a good weekend guys, you deserve it!
Hello?
John, what?
Come on John, it's too late for that stuff.
No, I really don't wanna talk about this right now, can you just please call me tomorrow morning?
All right, all right thank you.
Mr. Marwood, I'm Jim Baxford.
Yeah.
I left you a bunch of messages, 20 to be exact.
I, uh...
I'm off the clock you know, if you wanna talk...
I lost my life savings.
My house, my job, my wife...
Look Jim, it is not my fault your wife left you, all right?
She didn't leave me, she's dead.
Oh for fuck... come on man.
I'm telling you...
Just get off of me!
in the stability of the American economy cuts across the entire political spectrum.
For decades, America has been enjoying unprecedented economic growth but unfortunately that growth was fueled by a mountain of debt and now those bills are starting to come due.
As the economic collapse intensifies, opinions vary on how to stop the downward spiral.
Call this crisis by any other name, it's still the same old game... the rich still get richer and the poor get poorer.
Thank you everyone and good night, from New York News 7.
Wow, Dan!
This is amazing!
How did you do that?
You know it was really easy with the new mortgage incentive rate...
That's great, fantastic.
And you think that's going to be enough?
Absolutely, the bank will look great but our clients... not so much.
Okay, it's the only play we had... we took the shot and it's looking good.
Am I right?
Yeah, you were right all along.
Okay, well you know... that's what I like to hear, you know?

The question them becomes...
Like many other financial institutions,
Leman Brothers got caught in this financial storm.
The real estate superfund, which was one of the hottest products... 7.7 trillion in undisclosed funds from the Federal Reserve for struggling financial institutions.
We will be watching very carefully... there are those that believe the government does have a role to play...
I want to be very clear,
I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took.
JP Morgan Chase won and will assume $31 billion in won losses.
The loans came with virtually no strings attached.
However, eventually the bottom dropped out sharply and suddenly, leaving investors little...
The government stepped in nd helped one of its own...
Continue to squander millions of dollars... to use these events to negotiate more favourable...
We're not home right now but leave a message and we'll call you right back.
Mr. Baxford, it's Walt from the bank calling... uh, we've sent you letters and left you numerous messages about your mortgage default.
As per our conversation the other day, the bank has no choice at this time but to foreclose on your home.
If you've got any questions, feel free to contact me.
We're not home right now but leave a message and we'll call you right back.
I'm not answering the phone no more, so stop fucking calling, I don't wanna talk to you.
Mr. Baxford.
James Baxford.
Are you James Baxford?
Notice of eviction due to foreclosure.
You like doing this, kicking people out on the street?
I'm sorry sir, but you're gonna have to sign this document and pack up your things.
You will have 48 hours to vacate the premises.
Sir, if you and your belongings are not out of here in 48 hours, the sheriff will be here to remove you forcibly, so you should sign this.
Take this piece of paper and shove it up your ass.
That's fine Mr. Baxford, but you've been legally served.
And no loud music!
And that's not working, take the stairs.
Speaking of work, how's Jim?
I don't know...
I'll give him a call, see how he's doing.
He's been on my mind lately.
Hey Jim, we've been thinking about you!
Here I'm gonna put you on speaker, okay?
Hey man, we miss you at lunch.
Yeah, you should come join us.
I need more time guys, a little more time.
Well you take all the time you need, we just want you to know we're all there for you.
Yeah, don't run away from us, we're gonna help you get back on your feet.
I really appreciate it guys, I'll see you soon.
All right.
All right, man.
Bye.
These are the 2 pieces you were asking about, did you bring the dollars?
Looks good.
So where'd you serve?
10th...
Keith Stack referred me.
Stack's a good soldier.
Yeah.
Don't forget your clips.
Hey, I gotta ask you...
Are you in any way, shape or form associated with law enforcement?
I ain't no cop, I'm just a private citizen concerned about his personal safety, all right?
Yeah...
Grenades?
Oh yeah, I got 2 left, shrapnel.
How much?
I'll sell you both for a hunsky.
For personal protection?
For fun.
Grenades are fun!
You take it easy.
Hey asshole!
the vice president of a well-known brokerage firm was gunned down while walking to his car.
The killing appears to have been targeted, our correspondent is on the scene with an update.
Thank you, this is a developing story, uh... there are no suspects at this time, however it is believed the victim may have been targeted because of his involvement in the financial sector.
Police are still looking for clues and a spokesperson for them released a statement earlier today saying they're treating this as...
A majority of American voters now believe the United States could experience a total economic collapse.
Various types of loans became available to consumer who happily assumed an unprecedented debt.
...The latest Wall Street firm to receive federal money
It's about morality, we can't let these guys win, and also we want our money back from the United States government.
They gave the banks bailouts, we want our bailouts.
The law firm Leman Brothers currently in bankruptcy billed over 850 million in legal fees, in addition for billing in massage and lobster dinners.
Around 20 lawyers made over 40 million each before the people who actually lost money got anything.
The really amazing thing here is that the government awarded them the contract in the first place, without making sure they had the capital to cover these costs.
The people are angry and rightly so.
Find out in our full report right after the break.
...This speculation drove the value of the fund up...
Charlotte are you reading this?
Let's get some personal security in this office for me right now!
Of course.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Hey, look at this!
Jim!
What up man?
How you doing man?
Dude! How you doing?
Good man.
Hey Jim, good to see you.
How you doing, all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
Pretty good.
Oh come on, you don't have to do that.
I just fucking did, I miss you guys.
Yeah, me too.
Lunch hasn't been the same.
So what's been going on?
Not a lot, not a lot..
you know just been hanging.
I ain't been working.
It's tough you know, with Rosie gone and shit... it's not good.
You know, it is what it is.
Anyway, so uh...
I'm moving.
Moving? Where to?
I don't know, different city, different state.
Everywhere I go I keep seeing Rosie.
It's driving me nuts.
You get it, right?
I get it.
Hell, I understand.
I feel like doing the same thing sometimes.
No, I don't know why the hell she won't go.
It's a mystery to me!
She fucking loves you.
Oh yeah, she loves me.
She loves you, she loves everybody in the neighbourhood, that's the problem!
She hasn't bailed on him yet.
She loves me, right.
Well you gotta tell us where you're going, all right?
with all these fucking shootings, huh?
Yeah, it's a hell of a thing.
The whole city's on alert, look at that.
Yeah, the brass is afraid it's gonna escalate.
Really, they'll get him soon enough.
They'd better, the brass is screaming.
Whoever it is really fucking hates rich bankers, which only leaves a million suspects.
You know whoever catches this guy is gonna get a big promotion, my man.
Well in that case, I'll save you the trouble.
What the fuck are you talking about?
It's me.
Okay, you had me going for a minute there, all right?
I'm serious.
You'll give me a heart attack, what's wrong with you?
All right, who got the Reuben?
Always with the fingers, huh?
Sorry.
Don't want that, I'm gonna get an STD from this sandwich.
You ruined it for me, I'm serious.
I'm afraid to eat this sandwich, I'm gonna get a herpe.
You should put a condom on your finger, that's what you should do.
I think she's been going to the gym, you notice that?
My wife's ready to pop!
I got him a membership to our country club, it was like 90,000 plus.
That is crazy.
You're crazy.
I owe you too much money.
Hey, did you hear Stancroft...
Hey Robert!
It's Jim, Jim Baxford.
Jim Baxford!
Hey, it's good to see you.
from that little financial disaster of ours.
Not quite, but I'm getting there.
Well it was a tough time man, we all took a loss.
I mean, when I told my wife we couldn't vacation in Barbados, she tore a strip off me the size of Long Island.
But things get better, right?
Right, that's what everyone keeps telling me.
Trust me, it's true.
Look, um...
let me give you my new business card,
There we go, I've got a couple of uh, investment ideas you might be interested in.
I'll take you for lunch next week, huh?
I gotta run, it was good to see you.
Hey you too.
Yeah, call me.
Next caller, go ahead please.
I'm glad those bankers got shot.
There's no effective laws in this country anymore, you get 5 years for robbing a gas station, you destroy America... you get 20 trillion dollars and you walk away?
Violence is not the solution, Gus.
Isn't violence the official solution of our government in Iraq,
Afghanistan?
Thanks for your comments, Gus.
Next caller, who's on the line?
Why'd you cut Gus off?
I lost my house and Wall Street is getting a free ride...
Okay, that's all the time we have on today's show for call ins.
Let's look at today's market, the US dollar is trading at 1.31 against...
Robert here.
Robert, it's Jim.
Jim, how you doing?
but I won 50 G in a poker tournament.
Fucking unbelievable.
Anyway, I need some advice on what to put it in.
Oh great, well how about we have a coffee?
The place near my office?
Yeah, same coffee shop.
Okay. See you tomorrow, 9 o'clock.
Sounds great.
All right, see you then.
Yeah but you see, you see uh... 8-5-6, that's gotta jump up to 9-2-5.
No, no...
look at the, look at the right screen.
No, we gotta sell those shares right away.
drop off the other side, we need more points on that side. Shit...
I'm not the boss here...
You have absolutely no say in this.
Please, my wife... she's pregnant.
Maggie, get a hold of security now!
Hey, what the fuck is going on?
Get back to your wife and be thankful, you prick.
Get the fuck outta here!
Go!
Hurry, hurry run!
Go!
Copy that, 38th floor!
38th floor!
Police are looking into whether or not today's shooting spree has anything to do with the recent murders.
Now from what we know, all of the victims were involved in the brokerage scandal but there was a question whether or not the fraud charges could be prosecuted.
We know that the shooter is still in the building at the moment.
Get outta here.
Out!
Get out!
Whatever it is you want, this is not the way to get it.
Take a fucking seat, right there.
Sit the fuck down.
Bet you've never seen your desk from that angle before.
I don't know who you think it is I am but... this isn't gonna accomplish anything.
Did I tell you to speak?
You wanna know the difference between a banker and a gangster?
A gangster always has a getaway plan.
Okay...
And by the way...
I know exactly who you are.
You are the guy who fucks everyday people in the ass when you're not sitting in your fucking house in the Hamptons, or booking tennis lessons from your penthouse overlooking Central Park.
How do you know all this?
I've been watching you.
The problem with guys like you is you can't stop bragging.
you're making sure that every magazine in the country knows all about your triumphs.
Well, you know there are people that derive inspiration from success stories.
You know maybe you'd do all the same things I've done given the opportunity.
No, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't sell bad loans to people with small amounts of money.
You make yourself real cash based on fabricated nonexistent loans.
You cook the books to get your bonuses, that's what you fucks do.
But the question is, why should I let you live?
You're a salesman, right?
Sell me.
Sell you...
You know that there's not a person on this earth that's worth over a hundred million dollars that came by that money honestly?
The Vanderbilts, the Carnegies, the Gettys, the Morgans, the Hursts, the Rockafellers...
They just annexed territories and licenses and businesses and killed the native population and imported slaves and sold guns to both the north and the south during the Civil War and they're heroes, they're American heroes!
Take 5 on 38.
Coming down, proceeding to locate target.
We teach our children, what...
honesty and hard work are the keys to success?
My children... my children are not gonna go off to some war, they're gonna go to Yale, they're gonna go to Harvard.
And it's gonna be the dumb, stupid, white trash kids and the black ghetto kids that are gonna fight
America's senseless wars and they're gonna protect
American security and business, and it's gonna be my business.
richer and richer and my bonuses are gonna get bigger and bigger, and it's the same old story.
It's the bankers and the owners and the advisors that get rich!
And it's the little people, who buy their stock and always lose in the end.
To people like you!
Some people don't recover, people like me.
It's a free trade system, my friend.
That's capitalism.
That's competition in a capitalist society, that's how the cream always rises to the top.
That's how the strong survive and the weak die off.
Like her?
That's my wife you're looking at, she's dead because of you.
Come on...
I don't give a fuck,
I have never seen you before in my life.
But you do know about the real estate growth superfund,
That's where you put your money.
For the commissions, for the commissions.
That's how it works.
You like competition?
I love competition.
You wanna play a little free market competition, just you and me?
You and me?
I can't wait.
One weapon, two guys.
Winner lives...
On the count of 3... 1... 2...
Well, lookie here!
I came out on top.
That's what you don't understand,
What's important is that I won, doesn't matter how I won, and you're dead.
I cheated too.
Get him outta here!
Target located and eliminated.
I'm still alive and free and I promise I will keep killing.
They should all know that I am out there, a soldier of the people...
and if the government, the prosecutors and the judges fail on their duty,
I will not fail on mine.
BULLY:
I'm gonna kill you, Weinselstein!
[BURT SCREAMING]
BULLY:
Twerp.
- Unh!
Why you running away, Weinselstein?
I got you a birthday present.
That's okay.
You didn't have to get anything.
I got you some bark.
And you're gonna eat it.
[ALL LAUGH]
- Cool.
I was gonna eat bark anyway.
- No, you weren't.
Yeah.
See?
All the things you were gonna do to me, I was already planning on doing.
Mm.
Mm, so good.
Yummy.
Unh!
- You planning on not being able to breathe?
- Yes.
Listen to me, Weinselstein.
Nobody likes you.
Nobody will ever like you.
Do you understand that?
Come on.
Let's split.
Goodbye, loser.
[BULLIES LAUGHING]
[WHIMPERING]
Mom?
I'm home.
Mom?
MOM:
Happy birthday, little man.
I had to work a double shift again, but I love you very much.
Mom.
P.S. Dinner is in the fridge, and I got you your favorite cake.
It's on the counter.
Combine the mix with two tablespoons of oil and two eggs.
We're out of eggs, so you'll need to run out and get them.
Preheat the oven to 350 grease and flour a 9" x 13" cake pan and then pour the batter into the pan.
Careful not to spill.
Hello, my young friends.
I'm Rance Holloway.
You've probably seen me on The Merv Griffin Show or live onstage at the fabulous Stardust Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.
That's where I perform such tricks as "Skateboarding Ghost" "The Amazing Cordless Telephone" and my very famous "Mouth Birds" illusion.
Wow.
[RANGE LAUGHING]
Did you like that?
Of course you did.
That trick just blew your mind, because that's what magic does.
It blows people's minds.
Welcome to the amazing world of magic.
A world where you can astonish and enchant those around you.
Because everyone loves a magician.
And if you follow my instructions, they'll love you too.
Let's begin now with a simple illusion where we pull pennies out of our nose.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Alakazam!
- How'd you do that?
- A magician never tells his secrets.
- Oh.
Okay.
-It's a rubber thumb.
Oh, cool!
- I'm Anthony Mertz.
- Albert Weinselstein.
You're that kid who's always in the nurse's office, right?
Not always.
Sometimes they send me to the hospital.
What are those for?
This one's for my allergies, and this one's for my asthma.
And this is testosterone.
My doctor says I'm dangerously close to being a girl.
[BULLIES LAUGHING]
Do you know any other tricks?
I have a whole magic kit at home.
[GASPS]
Behold.
An empty top hat.
Perfectly normal.
Alakazam!
Wow.
You're like a boy witch.
Thank you.
Hey.
What if you put a plastic bag of water in the hidden compartment?
Then water would come out instead of confetti.
- Do you wanna be my partner?
- More than anything.
Okay.
I think we should start writing down our trick ideas.
- Like in a notebook.
ANTON:
Yes.
An enchanted notebook, with leather and buckles.
- All I have is a regular notebook.
- That'll work.
So then our first trick should be "Confetti Out of a Hat."
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[LAUGHS]
BURT:
Awesome.
- Ta-da.

I need you to dump Anton.
He's...
Well, he's homely.

What you may not know is that Burt and I have been magical friends and partners since we were young boys.
We always knew there was something a little bit different about our friendship.
Remember our games of Hangman, Burt'?
I sure do, Anton.
But we didn't play it quite the way the other kids did.
Ladies and gentlemen, our beautiful assistant, Nicole.

Night after night after night, lam in magic hell.
Could you take any more time making the switch?
- I'm standing under that cloak like an asshole.
- Give me a break.
I've been doing the switch the same way I've done it for the last 1O years.
You're just impatient.
I am impatient, Anton, because I have to share a cloak with a sweaty walrus-man.
You just want to get the show over with.
Could we get a towel for him, please?
Dab it down.
- I sweat because I work hard.
- Take my phone!
You think it's easy securing your safety harness in the dark?
Would you rather I let the noose just snap your neck off?
Can we do one show without this bitch-fest?
I'm sorry.
Are we hurting your performance as a walking mannequin?
- That's it.
You know what?

You need something?
- Thirty seconds till "The Burt Locker."
- You're Nicole.
Oh, wow.
Mr. Wonderstone.
That is a tremendous honor.
I don't think I'm ready to take on that.
I'm not rehearsed.
I would need several years of-- That is not an outfit.
Mr. Marvelton, this may be a bad idea.
- You're gonna be great.
- I'm terrified of crowds.
- Don't worry.
- You have no idea.
I have a fear--
Agh, that is tight.
Ugh.
- What?
She has no ribs.
- Ugh!
You took her hair.

It's an octuple king.
Biggest bed in Vegas.
Easily sleeps two dozen adults.
If the phone rings and I'm on the other side of the bed, I can't get to it.
There's no way.
Sword.
Ahh!
God, that was close.
The point is, it's a huge bed.
And I was wondering, would you like to see it tonight nakedly?
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea...
-...since we just started working together--
- Listen, Nicole.
-It's Jane.
- Sword.
[JANE GASPS]
I know this is your first show and it's all very new and fresh and exciting but when you have done this 5000 times you'll find that having sex with me is the only way to mitigate the miserable drudgery of your existence.
- My point is this.
Let's just have sex.
-It's not gonna happen.
- You a lesbian?
-ls every woman who doesn't sleep with you...
-...a lesbian?
- Mm, no.
I've slept with plenty of lesbians.
[AUDIENCE GASPS]
Wow.
I've worshiped you for 10 years and you've just made me hate you in 60 seconds.
Hmm.

Looks like I'm the one who scored this time, you dumb jock!

Let's see who we have.
Anyone?

Who will it be for "Man Head/Lady Body"?
Ahh.
Would you care to join me onstage?
How about a round of applause?
MIRANDA:
Mm.
I can't believe I'm really making out with Burt Wonderstone.
This must be the thrill of a lifetime for you.
Your place is so beautiful.
This is not my place.
This is my place.

Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful.

Oh, my God!
There you are!

Yes.
Come with me, please.
Ah.
Would you do me a kindness and jump up on the bench, please?
Legs facing that way, arms as if you're holding a giant pumpkin.
BURT:
Good.
So, Miranda, what are your hopes and dreams?
Well, I'd really like to own my own hair salons.
That's great.
You're interesting.
Follow me, please.

Hey, ahem, Jimbo!
Hey, there you go.
Sprinkle the infield there.
You've done such a great job today.
I just want to reward you for your excellent service with this $100 bill.
You're just gonna turn it into a $1 bill when I take it.
[CHUCKLES]
I don't know where that's coming from.
Who would do that?
That's mean.
A $1 bill is a horrible tip.
I'm giving you $100.
Heh.
Oh, my gosh.
You got me again.
Yes, I did.
You never learn.

This is a rare treat.
I can't remember the last time I saw you two together offstage.
We're both busy, that's all.
We see each other every day.
- So how's the show going?
- Not so good.
Good.
Pretty good.
It's okay.
I'm in the lobby doing the 2 to 2:30 shift.
Wednesdays through--
Well, just Wednesdays.
Plus I'm doing some webisodes.
- Drum up business that way.
- What the hell is a webisode?
Are you being serious?
What's a webis--?
It's a show that you do on the Internet.
It's just like being on TV or having a movie except you don't go through you know, all the hassle of people seeing it.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, one of my Bengal tigers has been getting a little bitey lately.
That's why I'm a comedy magician, not a big cat magician.
I want to kill onstage, not have some tiger rip my hand--
I don't want to get killed.
I want to kill on--
You know what?
Just forget it.
- It's tough.
- It is tough.
- It is tough.
- It was funny in my head.
If I spend more than an hour away from my cats they forget who I am and attack me.
Sounds like my wife and kids.
If, you know, by "wife and kids" I meant my ferrets.
You know, if I had a wife and kids and wasn't just home alone.
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
- What's going on out there?
- Eating Popsicle after Popsicle.
I don't know, we should probably go check it out.
Like, as a group?
Bunch of friends?
[CROWD CHEERING]
STEVE:
Appreciate it.
You seem like an open-minded crowd.
Things are about to happen here that may be difficult for many of you to process.
If you're at all squeamish, I encourage you to take shelter inside the casinos.
Move along.
Or just turn it off.
I'll give you a moment.
Congratulations.
You are truly brave.
I only hope you're ready to face the fire!
[CROWD GASPING]
Get it off!
Get off!
MAN:
He totally nailed you with that fireball, man.
Sorry.
Guilty pleasure.
You're a really good sport.
Whatever that means.
- Would you like to help me with a trick?
- Sure.
Now he done it.
Who is this hot mess?
That's Steve Gray, the street magician.
That guy's a magician?
He doesn't even have a costume.
STEVE:
Pick a card.
Show it to the crowd and that whole deal.
Now take the marker from your pocket and write your mother's name on that card.
But I don't have a--
MAN:
Oh, snap!
What's with all the cameras?
Oh, he's shooting his cable show, Steve Gray:
Brain Rapist.
-"Brain Rapist"?
- Yeah.
You live in a bubble or something?
STEVE:
Come on, come on, come on.
Dorothy.
His mother's name is Dorothy.
Pretty name.
I'm gonna take Dorothy, slide her into the center of the deck and put her back in my pocket.
Now punch me in the face.
- What?
- Punch me in the face.
Hard as you can.
- I'm not gonna do that.
STEVE:
Of course.
Sometimes the roles we're forced to play in life are difficult to understand.
Like your mother, Dorothy who, for the good of sailors everywhere, lived the life of a whore.
Whorethy.
That's what they called her.
Surrender, Whorethy.
You're not in Kansas anymore, Whorethy.
[BABBLING]
[CROWD GASPING]
- No, no, no. ANTON:
Jesus.
- Is that guy a plant?
- That looked like a real punch.
[STEVE GROANS]
It's okay!
I've already forgiven him.
I provoked him and awakened his pain body.
WOMAN:
Oh.
STEVE:
Wow.
That's swelling up pretty quick.
I better let the pressure off.
[CROWD GASPS]
[SCREAMING]
Better.
Ha-ha-ha.
Wait.
Feels like there's something in there.
Let me just...
[ALL GASPING]
[GRUNTING]
One!

Three!
Daddy!
I wonder what this could be.
It's the card!
MAN:
Oh, that's nuts!
As it was in the beginning so shall it be in the end.
I tried to warn them.
MAN:
That's it.
[CHEERING]
That's crazy, man!
STEVE:
Go!
Go!
Hello.
I haven't seen you around.
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
We caught your thing out on the street and it was disgusting.
Good.
Bad.
I don't eat from that tree.
Hey, any chance I can get you to sign something for me?
Oh, well, I don't usually sign autographs, but I suppose I can make an exception.
It's a release form.
Just in case we caught you in the background.
I don't want to have to pixelate your face.
Mm.
- Do I need to sign a release form?
- No, I can pixelate your face.
So, anywho, we have a show over at Bally's and I could get you some comps, if you'd like to take a look at our act.
We do this one trick, it's a man's head--
STEVE:
I tell you what.
Pretend I'm still here and tell me all about it.
ANNOUNCER:
From Chicago, Brain Rapist.
The world record for staring was 24 hours.
But I've been doing it for over three days now and, frankly, I'm bored.
So I'm gonna spice things up with a little pepper spray.
Bring it.
[SCREAMING]
Do you see me blinking?
I'm not blinking!
For a very long time!
[CONTINUES SCREAMING]
- He's like a god.
A god of pepper spray.
Uncomfortable, but in a great way.
Certainly not human.
BOTH". He broke the record!
Here at Bally's, you'll be pampered like an enormous baby.
There's a hair dryer and an ironing board in every room.
And if you like steakhouses... you'll love Sally's signature steakhouse, Bally's Steakhouse.
And after dinner, check out the Incredible Burt Anton in their own Burt Anton Theater.
[STEVE MILLER BAND'S "ABRACADABRA" PLAYING ON SPEAKERS]

Abra, abracabadbra
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Burt Wonderstone.
And I'm Anton Marvelton.
But, of course, you already knew that.
In order to achieve this impossible feat of impossibility we will need a female volunteer from the audience.
Who will that be?
Who will the female volunteer be?
All right.
Nope.
You're a dude.
DOUG:
Yes, $2 million.
Two point five million.
Okay.
I'm sorry about that, guys.
How are you?
I am incredible.
Mm.
Wow.
Look how big Judah's gotten.
- Yeah.
- How old is he now?
I don't know.
But I'll tell you what.
That kid?
That kid is your biggest fan.
Ah.
I love it!
Unfortunately, I'm starting to think he's your only fan.
Mm.
Ha, ha.
- What?
- Your ticket sales suck.
- Well, we have a following.
- You need a younger crowd, okay?
Have you heard of this Steve Gray guy?
Ah.
God.
Let me tell you about Steve Gray.
All that guys does is mumble and cut himself.
Anybody can do that.
My niece does that.
Heh.
Well, he's getting a national following between the ages of 25 and 45.
They're calling him the future of magic.
Would you like to see his latest stunt?
Mm-mm.
All right.
ANNOUNCER [ON TV]:
For 12 long days, he's held his urine.
No!
ANNOUNCER". Be there for the final hour of Steve Gray's incredible stunt.
- Ahh!
ANNOUNCER'. "Holding It In."
Is that a fountain over there? Seriously, could we turn that off?
That's not fair.
ANNOUNCER:
Live on Intense TV.
I'm sure this is normal, but my legs are shutting down.
What is going through your mind right now?
I really have to pee, Richard.
Yeah.
ANNOUNCER:
He's made it this far, but will he last?
He should be dead. Right now, he's got more urine than blood.
ANNOUNCER:
So join us this Friday at 9/8 Central on Intense TV.
A magician?
You call that a magician?
You actually enjoy that?
I don't enjoy any of this shit.
All right, Burt this is the brochure for my new signature hotel, Doug.
This hotel is the same as all the other hotels.
But I'm going to be charging 70% more for everything.
Now, do you know why I can do that?
- Because it's shinier?
DOUG:
Shut up.
Because it's new.
And people love new.
And when people love something, it becomes valuable.
So new equals valuable.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You've been doing the same shit since I hired you.
You even come onstage to that same goddamn song.
It's called "Abracadabra." And it is considered a modern classic.
-It's shit.
- I agree with him, Burt.
There's no reason we couldn't do something big.
Headline-grabbing.
I am not holding my piss!
DOUG:
Steve Gray already did that.
He owns that.
He owns it.
You need to do something else, something fresh.
I suppose I could hold my poop.
I'll have a large meal.
I'll eat some yogurt and granola.
And I'll hold my poop.
For 24 hours.
- What is wrong with him?
-"Will Burt poop?"
"Will it happen?"
"Will he crap his pants?"
I think I've got something.
MAN:
Keep coming.
REPORTER:
Now, why do you call it The Hot Box?
Well, the Vegas sun will effectively turn the Plexiglas box into an oven.
We estimate the interior temperature may hit 200 degrees.
And you and Burt Wonderstone plan to stay in the box an entire week?
That's right, reporter.
Hello.
Excuse us.
What are you wearing?
My magician's costume because I am a magician.
The whole point of this is to update our act.
You need to go change.
Now this is Vegas, baby.
Look at this crowd.
This is what I'm talking about.
This is awesome.
I wish I could come with you.
You don't want to do that, son.
It's gonna smell like ass in there.
JANE:
Okay, guys, we're ready for you.
- You're gonna wear that?
- Yes.

A nice view.
It's smaller than I thought it would be.
Okay, maybe if you'd come to even one rehearsal--
"Maybe if you'd come to rehearsal."
Maybe you need to rehearse sitting in a box, Anton.
I don't.
- Fine.
- Not this guy.

I can't breathe, I can't breathe!

- Some of his ribs are broken.
- You are so selfish!
Me?
I can't believe I put up with you for so many years!

I don't need you.
Nobody comes to see you.
They call it "The Incredible Burt Anton" not "The Incredible Burt theIncredibleAnton"!

- That is a hateful thing to say!
Whatever!
You're welcome to it!

- So?
- How are we gonna do the show?
- Nicole.
Let me explain something.
- Jane.
I don't need a partner.
I never needed a partner, certainly not Anton.
He was just a weight around my legs.
What did he ever bring to the equation?
Business acumen and ideas and friendship.
Pfft!
Better off without him.
- You think you can handle it on your own?
- Mm-hm.
- Give it a shot, because I can't watch this.

Now, what you may not know is that I have been magical friends with each other since I was young boys.
I've always known that there was something different about my friendship with myself.
Hey, remember my games of Hangman?
I sure do.
But I played them a little differently than the other kids.

What are you talking about?
You said you were gonna do a new show!
That was the same show, just without Anton!
You can't be magical friends with yourself!
Fine!
Any hotel in Vegas would kill to have Burt Wonderstone.
- Really?
- And besides, I put away a ton of money.
You put away almost nothing.
What are all these words?
This is gobbledygook.
- What about all my investments?
- Yes, okay.
Good.
What about them?
Here you go.
There's your imported Mexican spring water, Aqua de Leche.
That was a very classy product.
High-end packaging.
It's Mexican water, Burt.
You were selling the promise of diarrhea for three bucks a bottle.
How about the millions you put into that theme restaurant.
James Cameron's Titanic Cafe was a great idea.
Our only mistakes were:
A, made the floor too slanty, food kept sliding off the plates and B, did not get James Cameron's permission.
Gotta get permission.
We talked about that.
It's your lavish lifestyle.
Don't you understand, Burt?
You spent $75,000 last month on bed sheets.
Are you telling me that I don't have any money?
You have a savings bond.
Here.

- Oh, that's probably not a good idea, because--
BURT:
Well, here's the thing.
I have not eaten in 24 hours because it turns out that room service does not deliver outside the hotel.
Yeah, that's pretty standard.
I--

- Really?

It...
Very good.
Give it back, please.
I already did.

You can do a little sleight of hand.
- Oh, your wallet.

Oh, God, you really are broke.
Five dollars?

Don't crumple it.
I have millions of ideas for tricks, Burt.
Did you really think I wanted to be a magician's assistant?
- Yes.
JANE: No, Burt!
Make me your partner.
- Poor, sweet Nicole.
- My name's Jane.
My act is incredibly intricate.
It is a product of years of study and training and, no offense, but you are a girl.
You gotta be kidding me.
Not that girls can't do magic.
It's just that men are better at it.
You know what?
I don't want you staying here.
And I don't want to work with you.
Legally.
When I saw you ten years ago, you loved what you did.
I could feel it all the way in the back row and now you're just a sad, pathetic shell of what you once were and I don't want any part of it.

[RANGE LAUGHING]
COMMENTATOR [ON TV]:
This could win it!
ANNOUNCER [ON TV]:
Tonight on The Brain Rapist:
Will there be blood?
And that brings us to our profile tonight.
A man who left behind the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas stardom to follow a different path.
His name is Anton Marvelton.
I started Operation Presto!
because I saw how much suffering there was in the world.
I go to places where the children have neither food nor clean water and I give them magic.
And do you also give them food and clean water?
Well, no.
I'm a magician.
I bring magic.
Hi, kids!
Here you go.
That's for you.
Here you go, young man.
And for you.
Let's see that smile.
Ha-ha-ha.
Don't worry, I have plenty for everybody.
What have we here?
Presto!
Ha-ha-ha.
That's not all.
Hey, here you go.
How about that?
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
There you are.
That's for you, and you.
They should have fresh rabbits to practice magic with, don't you agree?
This area of the world is so troubled.
Not only is there rampant poverty and no fresh water but the locals are also hooked on a powerful drug called kratom leaf.
It knocks them unconscious for an hour.
So I'm trying to get them off the kratom and hooked on magic instead.
Now, you're here in part because you had a falling-out with your longtime magic partner and best friend, Burt Wonderstone.
ANTON:
He was my best friend.
He was like a brother to me.
And I'll always be grateful to him for showing me my first trick.
INTERVIEWER:
Do you remember what that was?
A disappearing handkerchief.
It's the first trick everyone learns, but I'll tell you what.
When Burt did it that day it really blew my mind.
Rance, let's do some tricks.
Rance.
Aah!
Jeez!
What are you doing here?
- I wanna do tricks.
- What are you doing in my room?
- Look what I brought.
Remember that?
- I don't care.
I thought that we could do some tricks together.
The whole point of the kit was so that you could do the tricks without me.
Ooh!
The dangling knot.
And the rings.
Remember the rings?
How do these work again?
If I show you how to do the rings, will you leave me alone?
We'll see.
Ugh.
Slide that one out, you need to get the fingers, and there.
No good.
I can see the corner of the card.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- There?
- Yeah.
Squeeze your fingers tighter.
- All right.
- Tighter!
How in the hell did you ever perform on a Las Vegas stage?
I didn't do very many card tricks.
I mostly worked with big giant props.
Big giant props.
Do you mind if I ask you something?
If you feel you should.
I mean, one day you were headlining at Bally's the next day you just disappeared.
Pass me the salt.
Do you remember why you became a magician?
Because everybody loves a magician.
Right.
H ow--?
How'd--?
How'd--?
What you're feeling right now that sense of awe, that sense of wonderment that sense that anything in the universe is possible?
That's why you became a magician.
That's why I became a magician.
- That, and the women.
- That, and the women.
So why did you just walk away?
I was on a stage one day and, all of a sudden, it had become rote it'd become mechanical and I didn't like that feeling.
So I walked away and I never looked back.
Hmm.
Honestly, how did you do that with the bird?
It's partially deboned.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
I'll be right there.
DOUG:
Burt!
Burt, how are you?
- Doug.
- Come here.
- How you holding up? BURT:
Very well, very well.
DOUG:
Have a seat.
Ah!
So like I said, I want to talk to you about performing.
Yes, yes, yes.
So, what do you think?
A triumphant return to Bally's?
Or, perhaps, a new show at your new hotel?
Well, actually, I had something else in mind.
Ah.
All right.
See, Judah is turning, um...
He's turning something, and we're having a little party at the house and when I asked him who he would like to perform at the party he told me he wanted you.
Really?
[CHUCKLES]
I know, I know.
I couldn't believe it either.
I offered him Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber and Mandy Patinkin.
But no, no.
He told me he wanted you:
The great and wonderful Burt Wonderstone.
Hmm.
For ten years, I played the biggest room in Vegas.
I traveled the world, I dined with kings.
- And now--
- I'll pay you 500 bucks.
- I will do it!
- Good.
Doug Munny asked me to perform at his kid's birthday party.
Ooh.
Are you gonna do it?
- I will if you'll be my partner.
- I don't know.
I'd have to shave.
Come on, Rance, it'll be fun.
I see it in your eyes.
When you do a trick, it's like you're 8O again.
I want to show you something that I think will change your mind.
I'm 75.
WOMAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, The Human Pifiata!
Now, this morning, I ate a thousand pieces of hard candy and I've got to get them out or I will surely die.
- What is this, an escape?
- I wouldn't count on it.
Come on, hit me as hard as you can.
Hit me!
Yeah!
Is that all you got?
[CROWD YELLING]
Oh, Jesus.
This is disgusting.
Can I be a magician when I grow up?
Maybe if you get good grades.
This is what they call magic these days?
This is some kind of terrible shit!
[GRUNTING]
Go, go, go!
WOMAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Gray.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[MOUTHS] Nicole?
[MOUTHS] Jane.
Goddamn, that's the worst thing I ever saw in my life.
And I saw my kids being born.
Holy mackerel.
Are you kidding me, Burt?
You never told us you were friends with the famous Rance Holloway!
It is an honor, sir.
- You're too kind.
LUCIUS:
Mr. Holloway.
What in the hell happened to you?
I work with cats.
Large cats.
I went on a date last night and one of them got jealous and ripped my face.
- Goddamn.
- Well, my girlfriend got it worse.
They said this was a magicians' bar.
- What are you doing in here?
- Mr. Gray.
What you do is not magic.
It is monkey porn.
I understand.
It's natural for a dying leaf to be frightened by the autumn wind.
-It's not about pulling a rabbit out of your hat anymore.
It's about pulling your heart out of your chest.
[MIMICKING HEARTBEAT]
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means I take people's nightmares and turn them into dream realities.
What in the fuck is a dream reality?
And you are...?
Hold on a minute, Steve.
You're telling us you don't know who Rance Holloway is?
- Never heard of him.
BURT:
We owe this man everything.
And you don't know who he is.
I didn't say I don't know who he is.
I said I've never heard of him.
Your skin makes me cry.
That's a very sick hombre.
Well, when do we start rehearsing our kids' show?
- Are you ready?
- Let's give it a try.
[BURT CLEARS THROAT]
- Say, would you like to go golfing?
- Sure!
Here you go.
Let's go golfing.
What?
[ALL LAUGH]
[ALL GASP]
- Rance Holloway!
RANGE:
Thank you.
BURT:
This is my handkerchief.
[LAUGHING]
Told you you'd do great.
Bun?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit my grandmother.
Hi.
- Hello, darling.
- Grace is your grandmother?
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
I entertain the residents.
I haven't seen her this happy in ages.
We're having an affair.
[GRACE GIGGLES AND BURT CHUCKLES]
BURT:
I don't get it.
I don't understand how you can work for Steve Gray.
You are so much better than that.
You didn't think that when I asked to be your partner.
Well, that was a different time.
Women didn't have the same freedoms that they do now.
It was a month ago.
Listen, I know he sucks.
I need a job.
And I don't have to defend myself to you.
- No, I know you don't, Jane.
- Thank you.
Did you just actually call me by my real name?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I've been such a jerk to you.
And that I was so unprofessional.
And that I always called you Nicole, even though I knew your name was Jane.
There's like a hundred more things on my internal checklist.
Okay.
That I objectified you, and that I always stood too close to you and that I yelled at you, and that I tried to make you feel uncomfortable, and that I--
Okay, you can stop.
Don't hurt yourself.
So whatever I did that was insensitive and stupid, I'm sorry.
Well, on behalf of all the Nicoles over the last ten years I accept your apology.
Thank you, Nicoles.
We were, I don't know, 10, 11 and there was this one kid in class who was always mean to us always picking on us.
So we tricked him into pulling flash paper out of the top of a wand.
It exploded in his face.
The whole class laughed.
- Oh, that must've been a good day.
- It was the best.
The next day, not so much.
Kid came back, beat Anton almost to death.
- Oh, no.
- He was all right.
- Least you had Anton.
- Yes.
I had imaginary friends, and even they were mean, so, heh...
- The life of a child magician.
- Yes, try being a girl child magician.
They called me Magic Bitch.
- They did?
- Yes.
- They called me Magic Bitch.
- No.
Well, no.
Do you have any gigs coming up?
As a matter of fact, I have a very important international gala known as Doug Munny's kid's birthday party.
- Oh, that's--
- Pathetic.
I know.
No. I was gonna say cool.
Kids love magic, right?
BURT:
Right.
I know you're probably busy but I was thinking maybe you could be there.
Ooh.
I am busy.
But I'll be there.
BOY 1:
Judah is so lucky.
Rance, it's Burt.
The party is today.
Just a gentle reminder.
Uh, call me.
- Ah, you made it.
- Yep.
Well, I love cake, so...
You ready?
I think I'm ready, but Rance isn't here yet.
So I'm a little--
- Rance is not here.
JANE:
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
- I'm not nervous.
Thank you.
JANE:
Right.
- Good luck.
- I don't need luck, I need Rance.
JANE:
He'll be here.
- All right.

DOUG:
Ladies and gentlemen I want to thank you all for helping me celebrate my son's...
- How old are you?
- Ten.
My son's 10th birthday.
Judah, my love my life my dreams.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Dad.
Now, of course, Judah's birthday isn't the real reason I invited you all out here today.
As many of you know, my new hotel, Doug, will be opening soon.
And in a few weeks, I myself will be hosting a showcase of Vegas' hottest acts.
Whichever entertainer dazzles me the most will be getting a five-year contract as Doug's headliner.
How about that, huh?
And I am very pleased to announce that we have our first official entrant into that competition right here with us today.
He's a world-famous magician.
Ladies and gentlemen Steve Gray!
[CROWD CHEERING]
DOUG:
Great to see you, Steve.
Thanks for coming.
And I'll see you next month at the showcase.
Ha, ha.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, to entertain the children Burt Wonderstone.
Thank you.
JANE:
Whoo!
I have a question for you.
Don't you wish you had a quarter for every time your parents told you to clean your ears?
ALL:
Yeah.
- Well, there's one.
BOY 1:
That's crazy!
ALL:
Ooh.
And, yes.
Oh, there's another one!
And the birthday boy.
When was the last time you cleaned behind your ears?
- Never.
- I didn't think so.
Because Judah has the grodiest ear of all!
- Whoa.
- You are rich, my friend!
BOY 2:
That's so cool.
BOY 3:
Amazing.
- Here you go.
STEVE:
Wait!
- You kids wanna see some real magic?
BOY 4:
Yeah.
ALL:
Yeah!
GIRL 1:
All right!
I'm pulling my thumb off.
That's not it.
Steve, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to be performing today.
Just giving the people what they want.
Hey, guys.
Check this out.
You know, if you're like me, you're probably thinking:
"That coin trick.
That was a tasty little hors d'oeuvre.
But my inner child is hungry and crying out for something more nourishing.
What have you got on the grill?"
WOMAN:
Oh, my gosh.
- What is he doing?
- What is he doing?
STEVE:
You see that?
You see what I'm doing there? Hmm?
Look at it. Look at it!
Now look at this!
[CHILDREN SCREAMING]
In cursive.
MAN 1:
Yeah!
- Mm.
That is a terrible trick to do for children. What if they try and copy you?
I'll sue them.
-It's my trick. BURT:
Hey, guys.
Have you ever been to a party and someone has on the exact same outfit?
BOY 4:
Definitely!
BOY 5:
Sure!
Well, here is a solution for that.
ALL:
Whoa.
BURT:
I thank you.
BOY 6: Amazing!
Wonderstone!
BOfing!
Here's how I hammer a nail.
[ALL GASP]
STEVE:
You need any work done around the house, let me know.
- Built my summer cottage that way.
- All right.
Very good.
Very good, indeed.
But this is a classic.
Meaning it's been done.
Judah, what is your favorite animal?
A mole, a sloth, a puppy?
'A PUPPY-
- A puppy.
A PUPPY-
Let's make a puppy for Judah's birthday, shall we?
There you go, a puppy.
Hmm.
It's not really that cute, is it?
Sort of a lame puppy.
I think I can do better.
I'll start again.
Alakazam!
Oh.
BURT:
There you are, my friend.
Happy birthday, Judah.
Wow, thanks.
I'm going to call him Wonderstone.
Can I see Wonderstone for a second?
Hey, everybody.
Watch this, everyone.
What an adorable little life form.
You know, I bet I can make him even smaller.
And a little less adorable.
- I like to squeeze him really hard!
- Stop it.
Give me the dog.
Give me that dog!
Give him to me.
Ash!
WOW!
Wonderstone has disappeared.
I wonder where he went.
Probably where all Wonderstones go eventually.
Into obscurity.
Daddy!
Daddy!
He crushed my dog!
Are you sure about that, Judah?
Are you sure about anything?
Because I think I hear something moving in this box right over here.
Go ahead and open that.
Wonderstone!
You're okay.
- Boom.
- Ha, ha.
That's a different dog, you sick bastard.
Where's the other one?
STEVE:
Don't you worry about it.
He's in a very safe place.
[PUPPY BARKS]
[PUPPY BARKS AND BURT GASPS]
TOP that, puppy pants.
Goddamn you.
[CHUCKLES]
BURT:
Happy birthday, Judah.
Chin up, Burt.
Bad things don't happen to us, they happen for us.
- Why couldn't you let him do just one show?
- Because I want that gig at Doug.
Not really, I don't care.
I want it.
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me.
Everything's in perfect alignment.
I've worked long and hard to get where I am and no one's gonna stop me.
Not Wonderstone, not you.
Not even me.
The future belongs to Steve Gray.
And in case you haven't noticed I'm Steve Gray.
Well, Steve Gray, you are a terrible human being.
And what's worse, you're a really bad magician.
So I quit.
Nice exit line, but I'm still here.
What are you gonna do now?
Walk off in a huff.
Excellent.
Ugh, women.
They're a mystery, Judah.
[PUPPY WHINING]
Bun?
Oh.
- He put a dog in my pants, Jane.
- I see.
- He put a live dog in my pants.
- I'm sorry.
- No one's ever done that to me before.
- I hope not.
He was teething.
So gross.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
What?
Rance.
- I missed the show.
BURT:
Oh.
Don't worry about that.
This is Jane.
Hi, Jane.
Rance Holloway.
Of course.
I know who you are.
- What happened?
- I had a stroke.
I don't recommend it, either.
It's not as much fun as they tell you in the brochures.
How'd it go?
Did you do the tricks?
Oh, it was fine.
Did they laugh?
Were they amazed?
They loved it.
It was great.
Great.
If I'd known how much fun it would be to work with a partner, I would have done it years ago.
[RANGE GROAN I NG]
Oh, my God.
It's time for my final disappearing act.
Goodbye, Burt.
JANE:
Where did he go?
He has gone to a better place.
Goodbye, Rance.
- He's under the bed.
- I know.
ANTON:
Hey, Weinselstein.
You came back.
But what about your work with the poor?
Yeah.
They didn't actually want magic.
They wanted food and clean water.
The fools.
Please.
So...?
So...
It's so good to see your face.
[WHIMPERING]
Would you like an onion ring?
-[SOBBING] I missed you so much.
- Oh, Burt.
- I just missed you so much.
- I missed you too.
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] After what I did to you at The Hot Box I didn't think you'd be my friend anymore.
I can't understand you.
I didn't think you wanted to be my friend anymore.
No, Burt, I'll always be your friend.
And I'll always be your friend.
I can't tell you what that means to me.
-[IN NORMAL VOICE] Yes, you can.
- It means a lot.
Your friendship means more to me than anything in the world.
Burt, stop.
[WHIMPERING]
So happy-
I'm so happy-
I'm so happy-
Oh, I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this.
I promised myself I was going to do this.
BURT:
Ah, there it is.
The enchanted notebook.
I've always kept it with me.
There are some really great ideas in here.
- What about "Raisin Storm"?
- We did it.
Arsenio in '91.
- What about "Stinky, Stinky 2x4"?
- That one's really hard on my back.
Oh, yes.
Listen, guys.
We just need one big trick for Munny's showcase.
Some sort of grand illusion that will really blow people's minds.
Hey, wait a minute.
What's "The Disappearing Audience"?
- Ugh, that was the trick we could never crack.
- Yes.
How do you make an entire audience disappear without them being in on it?
- You'd have to knock them out or something.
- Well...
- That herb thing.
- Kratom.
What?
It's a leaf they chew in Cambodia.
It knocks them right out.
We would have to drug a thousand people without their consent?
Hmm.
Mm.
JANE:
Guys, no.
What?
You can't be serious.
That would be dangerous and also illegal.
- She has a point.
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
We should test it first.
Do you think this batch is ready?
I don't know.
Check it.
[BOILING]
Do you think this batch is ready?
I don't know.
Check it.
Okay.
Does everybody know what they're doing?
- I'm ready. - Me too.
But I am a little nervous.
Anton, what could possibly go wrong?
Somebody could die.
We can go to prison.
See?
When you say it out loud, it doesn't sound so bad.
Jane, Anton and I have been talking.
And if we get this gig, we'd like you to join us.
- I'd love to.
- Not as our assistant.
As our opening act.
We think that you're a hell of a magician, and we would like you to be our partner.
JANE:
Oh!
All right.
Heh.
Okay, I'm just gonna head out.
Happy for you GUYS-
Sorry, sorry.
Forgot my sweater.
Okay.
Bye.
Happy for you.
JANE:
All right.
- Oh.
- I believe that this is yours?
Very good.
Mm.
Oh.
You have, urn, something in your ear.
- Very nice.
JANE:
Thank you.
Unfortunately, I don't think that will work for me.
JANE:
Aah.
- Really?
- No, it's just for the trick.
Oh, okay.
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] He's touching me where it doesn't feel good.
[IN LOW VOICE] What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
L-lup-
Okay!
Okay!
Yeah, that was something!
Okay, get off.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Ahem.
Sorry about that.
Heh.
[ALL LAUGH]
Next up, a man who lives on the cutting edge and the burning edge and the gouging edge of magic.
You may know him from his TV show, Brain Rapist.
So prepare to have your brains raped.
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Gray!
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
Thank you.
But I'm not here for applause.
I'm different than the other magicians you'll see tonight.
In fact, I'm not planning on doing any magic at all.
Instead, I want to do a little thing I call:
Now, according to my research, there's a narrow angle where one can drill into the skull missing all the vital parts of the brain.
[AUDIENCE GASPS]
STEVE:
Now, I've been informed by my medical team that I may lose one of my senses leaving me with only five.
And no longer special in any way.
Yes, just like one of you.
So cross your fingers for me.
Oh, and, parents, if you have small children with you you might want to lift them up so they can see better.
All right, without further delay let's change everything.
[AUDIENCE GASPING]
[LAUGHS]
[AUDIENCE GASPS]
Oh!
Ta-da.
[ALL GASP]
MAN:
That was great!
- Thank you.
WOMAN:
Do it again!
Hey, when did you guys get here?
Oh, I left my drill.
I left my drill out there!
I left my drill!
Oh, boobies.
DOUG:
That's why he's a star, ladies and gentlemen!
Steve Gray!
Let's hear it!
Ha, ha.
Thank you.
I feel bad for anyone who has to follow that act.
[CHUCKLES]
And now, to follow that act Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton, ladies and gentlemen!
Yes!
Ha, ha!
ANTON:
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
For 15 years, Anton and I did a little show called:
"Burt Anton:
A Magical Friendship."
But as some of you may know, we recently had a falling-out.
Yeah, we fell right out of The Hot Box.
[ALL LAUGH]
See, ladies and gentlemen, along the way we forgot the most important thing of all, and that is that Burt needs Anton.
Oh.
And Anton needs Burt.
Because that is what a magical friendship is all about.
Tonight, we offer you the one illusion that we dreamed about as kids but never dared perform until now.
I guess you could say that this trick started 3O years ago on my birthday when I was given a Rance Holloway Magic Kit.
And I watched the instructional video for the very first time.
Hello, my young friends.
I'm Rance Holloway.
You've probably seen me on The Merv Griffin Show or live onstage at the fabulous Stardust Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.
Magic is the art of making people believe something they know can't possibly be true.
For example, if I were to say to the man in the second row aisle seat:
"That's the ugliest goddamn orange sweater I have ever seen" you might be astonished, because there's no way I could've known what he'd be wearing when I recorded this 3O years ago, right?
Well, let me tell you something, folks:
You ain't seen nothing yet!
[AUDIENCE GASPING]
[AUDIENCE GASPING]
No, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Because now Burt and Anton are going to make all of you everyone in this audience, man, woman and child disappear from this very theater.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
WOMAN:
Where are we?
Oh, my God.
ANTON:
Thank you!
Thank you!
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you.
ANTON:
Thank you!
BURT:
Thank you!
We did it, Anthony.
We sure did, Albert.
Burt, Anton!
Congratulations!
You got the gig.
I don't know how you did it.
- This was one hell of a trick.
- Thank you, Doug.
DOUG:
And I was sure this was gonna be a disaster.
Just one thing.
You're gonna make the audience reappear again at the Doug, right?
Not a problem.
Because I make a shitload of money off them in the casino.
All right.
Very proud of you.
Yeah.
Not bad.
But wait till they see what I have planned.
I'm gonna drill a hole in my head.
Right here.
Ahead of my time.

You're live with Larry King in our special report... and continuing coverage on Vatican City... where details remain unclear, but officials have confirmed the theft... of one of the Catholic Church's most coveted possessions.
Early speculation is that the Shroud of Turin... the burial cloth of the prophet Jesus, has been taken from its safe keeping.
Most experts are already pointing to Giovanna Nocera... the notorious European spy outed at the turn of the century.
Others are calling it a smoke screen set up by the church itself.

Cory, you heard the baby crying, didn't you?
I thought that was you.
Maybe because you're starving him.
Where's his Yorbetal?

The baby's Yorbetal, his medicine.
Where is it?
Oh, we're out.
What do you feed my baby brother, huh? This?
And where's his Yorbetal?
I told you, we're out.
You're taking pills again?

I don't understand why you have to do this right now at this time.
But you know the theater only puts on three shows a year.
This is the last one and they've offered me the part.
How do I say no?
Do you get paid?
Yes... half rate.
Half rate?
Well, I mean, the rest is deferred.
It's based on ticket sales.
And the role?
It's perfect.
It's the musical Planting Seeds In Cement.
You remember, okay--
It's Little Shop of Horrors meets Sling Blade.
It's the role of the botanist who discovers that the poisonous plants have voices.
It's huge.
The poisonous plants, they sing?
It's kind of silly, honey.
How'd you end up on the curb?
It started with that fateful call.
That call you missed.
The call I got, changed my life.
Was Tuesday night like any other when that phone rang.
I knew I could trust the voice right away, for no other reason except... knew one of my most personal secrets, something I've never shared with anyone.
What did someone say that could convince you?
She knew.
I got my hair cut every 3,000 miles.

What does that mean?
Every time I got my car's oil changed, every 3,000 miles, I'd get my hair cut.

Oh, no, I know that look.
Why does every character you play die?
It's the biggest moment in the piece!
Of course, it is, any time a character dies on stage it's big.
I don't write the plays.
All right, I got it.
I got it.
Why can't you try a role that, you know, has some growth?
That actually learn something, that has happy ever after.
Why is someone who's dying or killing themselves?
How does he go?
Let me guess, death by poisonous plant?
Well, I mean, not exactly.
Oh, really?
The third act.
All right, it's a step up.
Yeah, it is.
I think it's the role that's gonna launch me.
Now that I'm having a child, I am not going out there and watching you die.
- - I'm not. -
- Okay, it's not...
It is not me, it's my character.
Whatever.
It's a skill and I'm good at it.
You good at dying?
You know, babe, you're sick.

Ah, no.
What else do you need?
Ah, a bottle of Yorbetal, Infant Yorbetal.
Make it two.
Okay-
Anything else?
No, that's it.
That's $44.17, let me get you a bag.
I've got it.

Delivery service?
ALEXA:
Yup, that's me.
You schedule a delivery?
Yes, you have room on this?
Of course, I do.
The package is very delicate.
Well, worry not, my friend.
I guarantee its safe arrival.
Oh, ah, cash only.
How much?
Cross town--
Rush delivery.
How rushed?
There is only one rush.
Well, consider it done, but that kind of rush is gonna put you at the top of the list.
And will probably run you, I say $25.
Rush delivery.
Okay?
You got it.

(DOG BARKING)

Check this.
Would you tap that?
Come on.
Thank you, thank you!
You know you're gonna have too pay me for this?
What?
It's my business.
I don't do this kind of thing for free.
Fine, whatever, just go, go, go, go.
First lose the hat.
( MUSIC CONTINUES)
DOM:
Wait, wait, wait!
Not this way!
Why?
Shit!
- - Get off. -
- What?
- - Trust me, quick. -
- Thanks for nothing.
Wait, wait, wait!
Come back!
Uh, kiss me.
Uh, you can stop now.
Do I have to?
Well, your friends are gone and I think they would appreciate it.
I'm Alexa.
You saved my ass.
I was dust.
Hmm.
Well, I guess we will never know now, will we?
Uh, I'm Dom.
Can you get me out of here?
Or something?
Or something sounds good.
Come on, get on.
Hang on, yeah?
( SOFT MUSIC )
That guy was acting so strange, like he knew you or something.
Drop the hat.
He said something about how he used to watch you.
What's your story, dude?
Brown, I'll tell you, you gotta start listening to what people don't say.
It's the best way to stay focused.
How about right up there?
Where?
For the drink...
and the something.
I do have some time.
( ROCK MUSIC )
I'll have soda.
What can I get you?
Ah, two cokes.
Two cokes.
- - Yeah, that's it.
- - Cortez!
What do you mean, that's it?
What?
If all you want is two lousy cokes, hit the vending machine over at the Y.
Okay, easy.
Just the two cokes, okay?
Look at this guy.
Don't let him fool you.
Every day he comes in here and eats a plate of cavatelli with three meatballs.
This is a two-meatball establishment.
See that menu!
Patrons order and get two meatballs.
And if you are gonna bring this sweet lady in here and just order two cokes... then you can kiss the third meatball goodbye.
( BELL DINGS )
What's with that one?
Don't pay no attention to her.
Come on.
Alexa, Sal.
Sal, Alexa.
- - Nice to meet you.
- - Likewise.
Come on.
Hey, those jokers out there hanging your sign... you gotta keep an eye on them.
I know it.
That's a cool jacket.
Thanks.
Where do you get a jacket like that?
You make it.
Get out of here.
Really?
Careful.
I like the view from up here.
Why are they after you?
Aw, stupid reasons.
They must have thought I was dealing or something.
Were you?
No, no.
Then I'm glad I helped.
Yeah, but you didn't know that at the time.
You could have been helping the wrong guy.
Well, who's to judge, I mean... doing what I do, I could be helping the wrong guy every single day.
I got a target on my back, though.
I never should have climbed on with you.
Don't worry about it.
I'm a multi-tasker.
I just like to see how much I can handle at once.
And you seem to fit.
Watch.
I can listen to my music while calling a friend on the phone.
And--

No, I'm still in town.

Or what you do to me.
Time changes every second and so do we.
Evolution right before your very eyes.
You live life.
I like that.
I kinda need that.
Where are you going?
This was nice, but I have to finish my day.
No, I mean on the phone you told Gwen that you didn't leave town yet?
Oh, that.
Very perceptive.
I've been saying that for weeks now.
What keeps you?
Every day a reason to stay... finds me.
DOM:
Which way you headed?
West!
How'd you know?
This adventure you're heading on, all great adventures go west.
Open road, chasing sunsets.
Well, I don't know about that, cowboy.
But just to get out there... and find that thing.
What if... that reason wanted to come with you?
Let me finish this first.
Wait here, I'll be back here in an hour.
( ROCK MUSIC )

( SCOOTER APPROACHING )
Hey, you.
I thought you were gonna wait for me?
I was.
I will.
All that talk about things changing every second.
I got a feeling you weren't coming back.
Yeah.
This is crazy, I mean...
I don't even know you and--
This can't work.
Let's figure out why not.
Come on, get on.
Come on!

Nope, first the delivery.

I didn't say anything.
Got it.

Is ball in play?

Cannot confirm.
Another ghost.
Don't be disappointed.
As long as the day ends clean, ghosts never disappoint me.
Okay, I'll be the disappointed one.
Fuck!
Listen, Marti, if there's a mark to bring in, we do it.
Bitching that the mark may not exist is a little twisted.
- - Unless intel can't locate it.
- - Yeah, sure.
I need to bring one down.
I want to bring one down to send a message straight to the top.
All within the law.
The law!
You got it?
Whose law?
They're not out there playing by our rules.
If we don't play it by our rules, we're the same as them.
Okay, ease off the nobility juice.
I gotta be honest, your angle is way off on this.
Way off!
Write it up, Cub Scout.
And don't forget to cash your check when innocent kids die.
Come again?
What's that?
You want to talk about noble ground?
You would sell your nobility for a week's wage at any given moment.
GEAC:
Mark located.
Info received.
Apprehend mark.
Await further instruction.
Marti, please don't make me worry about you, okay?
No cowboy shit, just stick to procedure.
There it is, 764.
Potential mark spotted entering the house, 764 Harper.

Do you agree that the church should take some responsibility here?

But we're not just talking about someone here.
Giovanna's network is known to reach well beyond Europe.
Network, Larry?
I thought this was a spy we were talking about.
Sounds like you're ready to call her a terrorist.
You said that, not me.
Heading out?
On your knees!
Yes, sir.
Hands behind your head.
Up, come on!
Come on, we're going in the house.
Let's go!
- - Stay put! -
- Okay, okay.
CLYDE:
Come on, come on.
- - Get up. -
- We're taking the mark in the nest.
I'm innocent.
Innocent men don't run.
Innocent men sometimes must run.
Oh, look!
That's a lot of cash.
A lot of cash for an innocent man in a neighborhood like this.
SAHEL:
I earned it, hard work.
I know my rights.
Where is your warrant?
- - Huh?
- - Hmm?
- - Feel that?
That is nothing compared to... -
- Marti!
How it's gonna feel when I strap this straight to your tongue.
Marti, look, just--
Why don't you take the back rooms, I'll deal with him.
GEAC:
Mark two within perimeter.
Exact location unknown.
Copy.
COPY-
No materials located on mark one.
GEAC:
ls search complete?
Negative.
Marti, back room, come on!
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ!
We don't have time for this.
We need to call in The Bag.
Listen, get the fuck over here!
Listen, listen!
Take it easy!
Take it easy.
You are way out of line.
You jumped him out of the gate.
We don't have time.
Until this goes Code Zero, we got nothing but time.
I am not calling The Bag.
I've never called The Bag, I'm not starting today.
I am not gonna be the one responsible when these aliens set a bomb off on my soil!
Who said anything about a fucking bomb?
This isn't even a Code Zero, it's standard procedure.
Wake up!
Look around!
This thing could be a Code Zero in a matter of minutes... and if we're not prepared, I'm calling in The Bag.
Hey, listen to me!
Listen to me!
This is not a fucking Code Zero, all right?
Our job is to clear the nest and extract whatever information we can from the mark.
Just go and clear the fucking nest!
Have a seat.
Look, I'm not gonna touch you.
She's not gonna touch you again, okay?
You may just be innocent, contrary to what's already happened.
We're not here to judge you, either way.
We have information that links you to a chain that may be transporting illegal materials.
I don't do this.
Listen to me, all right?
Okay, listen to my words and we'll find out exactly what you know.
Razor, fire, cloud.
Master.
Wreck.
Master.
SAHEL:
You fucking pig.
You have no soul.
Is that so?
What else?
Your life will die.
Yes, eventually.
Your way of life.
Everything you stand for.
Your work, your belief... is about to crumble and die.
How's it going to happen?
Look around.
It's happening.
There's not much happening here.
It will.
When will this happen?
It already has.
I was just cleaning up now.
What are you cleaning?
Your blood.
We are cleaning your blood from our world.
What are you using to clean?
Ah-.
- - A bo...
- - A bomb?
A what?
You've put a bomb into play in our soil?
CLYDE:
So unbelievable.
I've got one shot at this.
What could possibly possess you to interrupt?
He said bomb!
I will not confirm that!
He said it!
He didn't say bomb!
I will not confirm it!
Now is there anything in the back?
No, and quit acting so goddamn patient.
First sweep, nest is clean.
Mark offered hints, nothing solid.
GEAC:
Copy.
Hold your position.
Second mark is on the board and locked.
The Bag is onsite.
You didn't.
( STEPS APPROACHING )
I did.
( DOOR OPENS, CLOSES )
Long time, no see, Clyde.
So, you're the sand turd that won't give these fine people the information they want?
Should we do it in here?
There's a room in the back.

Tick-tuck.
Yeah, right?
Bring me in with no more time for any fun.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, I get it.

Is that right?
(GURGLING, CHOKING )
Your friend here.
He passed off a brown box to a messenger service.
Paid cash.
Sent it across town.
The box was delivered to him earlier today.
He has no idea what's in the box nor where it's going.
He's one cog in a network that's moving it.
Far as he knows, it's already on to another.
The second mark.
Which way to the toilet?
Call it in.
The toilet?
In there.
Minimal information obtained from the mark.
He used an unknown messenger service, delivered it to an unknown location.
Probably the second mark.
GEAC:
Location of second mark confirmed.
Transmitting coordinates now.
Requesting information for first mark.
GEAC:
Remove from premises.
Pursue second mark.
Until we meet again.
You called her in, you deal with it.

I'm talking to you!
I am truly fucking sick of this shit.

What time is it?
It's now the top of the hour and you're tuned in to the evening news.
I'm hungry- Keep digging.-
You're bound to find something.
BROWN:
I'm digging!
What time did you say it was?
It's 2:00 o'clock, Tom.
Now back to you.
Already 2:00?
Already 2:00... and yes, Tom, according to the polls, one again, it's 2:00 and you're hungry.
My name is Brown.
(MUMBLES)
Don't you find it a bit strange.
Whenever I tell you the time, your reaction is, "I'm hungry. I'm hungry."
BROWN:
Cut the shit, I'm Hungarian.
We here at the station feel it's the public's right to be informed... of this clock determines hunger conspiracy.
BROWN:
Cut the shit.
Reporting from the street...
I see the well-behaved clock watching civilians.
The true machinery of the city.
It brings back sad memories.
Now back to Tom.
We haven't eaten since the butt crack of dawn.
Quit talking like some idiot.
Call it what you want, I call it old fashioned, gut wrenching hunger.
And what's all this about memories?
Back in the day, the salad days.
Before that fateful call--
That call you missed?
I don't think a man can get through life without getting the call.
I never got any call.
Consider yourself lucky.
It's not just getting the call, it's answering the call that's important.
( LOUD BANG) Ow, damn it!
We're sending you now to Brown on the inside with more.
Please, reason with them.
There ain't nothing to eat in there.
I'm feeling faint.
Holy-- don't get carried away.
We're gonna get back in the game, Brown.
Back in the game, come on, get out of there.
(BLUES ROCK)
I could eat the ass of a low flying duck.
How much money you got on you?
Um, five bucks.
Five bucks?
Feel like getting a hot chocolate?
Yeah, sure.
Hm, I feel like a coffee, you're buying.
I think I actually left that five at home.
Tom, back in the game.
Help us on the way?
Help.
Hey, you two can't be out here loitering and harassing these good people.
Don't be calling me no loiterer.
I pick up and throw away any trash I see.
According to local authorities... the homeless survey was reported as harassment.
- - Survey?
- - Yeah, a survey.
Exactly what sort of a survey are the two of you conducting?
That story and more will be coming up after this short break.
Do you need some change?
Would you like to borrow some money?
- - Thank you.
- - God bless.
Hey, what sort of horse pucky is that?
Now listen, guys, I'm not gonna tell you again, but you--
You're gonna have--
I'll be damned.
You, uh... you are--
What's his name?
Wow.
The best way to deal with ignorance is to recognize it.
I used to watch you every night.
So, and, was I good?
- - You were fantastic.
- - Thanks.
How in great goodness does it come to this?
Wasn't just one thing.
He missed his call.
Told you I did not miss my call.
It had something to do with the science of cloning.
The science of cloning?
Yep, they're gonna clone the big guy.
I know how you feel, I've been there, but now I'm back in the game.
(BLUES ROCK)
Sweet lordy be.
What's wrong with that cop?
Why?
Why was he acting so strange, like he knew you or something?
Sometimes people mistake me for someone else.
They'll be happy to know that I'm back in the game.
Ah, he said something about he used to watch you.
What's your story, dude?
Brown, I'll tell you, you gotta start listening to what people don't say.
It's the best way to stay focused.
All I can focus on is my hunger.
Ooh, yeah.
That is style.
Help is on the way.
Aren't you--.
That's right.
It's me.
Hmm.
We are now sending you live to the street where Tom has more.
We apologize for our audio difficulty... but the way things seem out here today...
I believe we'll get a reminder.
Reminder that I'm starving?
Into the microphone, Tom.
I will not talk into your fake microphone until you address me by my name.
On the reminder, I'm referring to a Mr. Brown.
Can be as simple as a sneeze.
Just that something to remind people that they're still alive.
Listen, I don't know what you're talking about or why you talk the way you do.
What I do know is that guy, that cop, and a couple others... looked at you like they know you from some place.
And then you throw out the science of cloning?
Who are you, dude?
I'm not keen to why people look at me like they do.
But I do know this.
You are one observant little fellow who stopped to do a little thinking.
My advice for that, don't forget to start up again.
Well... what are we gonna do with this?
Ooh, where did you get that?
While you so cleverly had that big, dumb cop distracted...
I took advantage of my position and kindly removed it from his holster.
You dog, you dirty dog.
Well?
What are we gonna do with it?
Wake up, Brown.
Wake up.
In the words of the great Howard Jones...
"Ours is the age which is proud of machines that think...
"and suspicious of men who would try to."
So, for Christ's sakes, man...
Let's make them suspicious.
Hm? Hm?
Hey, yo. hey, yo!
Hey. yo. hey, yo, what?
Little man, step up.
Do you trust these clowns?
Not by the looks of them.
Yo, where'd you get that lid, man?
Oh, this hat, they were having a sale at Macy's.
Whoa.
Not the answer I was looking for, little man.
Chill out, homie, I just picked it out of that trash can over there.
See?
That can right there?
Good enough.
Let's roll.
Did you see the paper today on the Vatican?
How am I gonna explain that to my kid?
Hey, Bob, did you shower today?
Of course.
Did you use soap?
I used a lavender body splash from McGurkin's.
Yeah, well you smell like aquarium rocks.
Hand me some wire, not the speaker wire.
(BLUES ROCK)
One full slice is all I need and I'm good two days.
What do you say we put that gun to good use?
(CLIMACTIC MUSIC)
DOKE:
That's right, buddy.
Witnesses claim the two entered the pizza joint... where the little one pulled out the gun and held everyone up.
While his counterpart grabbed two pizzas... one plain, one pepperoni.
But then we'd be out of the game.
And I hate pepperoni.
That's why I got you the plain, man.
(CLIMACTIC MUSIC)
DOKE:
We're live outside of First Union Bank... where two vagrants are holding ten people... hostage with a hand gun.
30 squad cars and ten helicopters... await their hopeless getaway.
Even worse.
How about we sell it to a gang?
Gangs don't need guns.
They're gangs because they already have guns.
I've got it.
Well, that's fantastic!
No, of course, I'm in.
Yeah, she's my wife.
But it's my art and I don't have to check inwithheraboutmyactingcareer .
I look forward to it, yeah.
I'll see you then.
Finally.
( DOOR BELL RINGS )
Your dog can come in, but you have to wait outside.
Good one, Shane!
How's business?
SHANE:
Oh, it's okay.
It's like the weather, day to day.
Just checking up on our local proprietor, seeing how things are, that's all.
Yeah, just seeing how things are.
You two are acting kind of different today.
Where's Mala?
Oh, she's in the back.
Why?
Oh, as a member of the same community as you... my business associate here and I, we're just a little worried... what with all the problems out on the street.
Just want to make sure you were feeling safe, secure.
- - Out of harm's way.
- - Yes.
I'm good, yeah.
And if so, what are you two gonna do about it?
Just want to make sure, you know... you had yourself some protection.
- - Protection?
- - Yeah.
Would steel put you at ease?
Where'd you two get a gun?
Let's just say we're back in the game.
What do you think?
( SIGHS )
I don't know.
Ten clams, it's yours.
Ten, huh?
It's a bargain.

How about those Steelers?

Cranberries.
Cranberries.
What the hell are you three talking about?
Cranberries.
Yeah.
( DOOR BELL muss )
Shit, the cheese.
I seem to have misplaced my firearm.
Misplaced?
I know that sounds strange.
But I had it earlier and now it's gone.
Friend, it sounds like you need to be more astute.
SHANE:
If I see anything, I'll be sure to report it to you.
Thank you.
I guess that's all I can ask.
Go back in an hour to collect?
Ten bucks?
Well, as long as he doesn't give it back to that numbskull.
Five each.
Nicely done, Doke, if that's your name.
What?
You can try and move around it with your fuzzy logic.
But I've seen it there and I've seen it out here.
What?
Plus, I've noticed you talking kind of funny... like you're talking to someone that isn't there.
Somebody I can't see.
Haven't you ever watched television?
What?
Listen, if you'll answer, I'll explain.
Have you ever watched television?
I've looked at television through the glass when it sits on display.
Well, not long ago, I was the anchorman for the local news.
Anchorman?
I was the host of the show.
I reported the news or tried to.
It was my face on the tube.
Delivering the stories of the day.
- - Yes, John Simchak, Channel 7.
- - You?
At 6:00 and 11:00.
You were a celebrity?
I wouldn't say that, but I was definitely in the game.
And that's why some people stop and stare.
They still notice this old face.
(BLUES ROCK)
How'd you end up on the curb?
It started with that fateful call.
That call you missed?
Call I got, changed my life.
It was Tuesday night like any other when that phone rang.
I know I could trust the voice right away.
For no other reason, except knew one of my most personal secrets.
Something I never shared with anyone.
What did someone say that could convince you?
She knew...
I got my hair cut...
every 3,000 miles.
What does that mean?
Every time I got my car's oil changed, every 3,000 miles...
I'd get my hair cut.
Doke, that's fucking weird.
What's really weird is I'd never used the same garage or the same barber.
Regardless, she let me know she knew this and more about me.
It was enough to get my ear.
It was explained to me then.
An underground movement had been in motion... and was about ready to reach the mainstream.
I guess I had been profiled, I was told.
I was chosen, the one to deliver the news to the world.
Hell, I already had the attention of quite a few people.
A team composed of the top scientific and theological minds.
Obviously well educated and extremely well financed.
Whose first plan was to clone the prophet Jesus.
DOKE:
Now, I've heard of cloning sheep.
Maybe even humans, but Jesus.
I was completely sucked in.
I guess they're gonna take DNA from the blood off the Shroud of Turin.
That's the cloth they wrapped around his body when they buried him.
It raises all kinds of questions.
He's supposed to come again.
Why not through cloning?
Who knows?
Maybe he's already here.
Remember, this was years ago.
On the day of the scheduled meeting, I tried--
Believe me, I followed the instructions.
I tried to be there... on time.
But everything that could possibly get in my way, did.
It's funny how nothing gets in your way when you're not in a hurry... and that's no excuse.
A few minutes.
Guys go a few minutes late.
Who knows what I missed?
Maybe all the information and proof I'd need.
Maybe the even the shroud itself, everything.
And I would need to bring to the world... one of the most significant stories of all time.
The greatest reproduction--
The cloning of Jesus.
DOKE:
But the plot didn't end there.
They have plans to bring them all back.
Muhammad.
Sedata.
Lao-Tsé.
Smash the line between science and religion... so those people can figure out the sciences of religion.
Evolution, no?
Yeah.
The Jews, the Christians, the Muslims.
The Hindus, the Buddhists.
Taoists.
All slaves...
to time.
DOKE:
People waiting, biding their time.
Yearning for a real experience, a true moment.
Free of this song, sad routine we're all locked into.
Now something's on its way.
To straighten out this damn mess.
But I missed my chance, then couldn't get there.
It's pretty much the beginning of the end for me.
But for that...
I'm a better human.
A wiser man.
Wow.
You?
You were on television?
And now...
I'm here with you.

When did you pick her up?
Man, I didn't pick up nobody.
SHAMU:
Oh, shit, Fuel
Fue, what the hell are you doing back there?
I needed a ride.
Needed a ride?
They got taxis for that shit.
My feet are sore.
And them swollen-ass feet almost got you capped.
Now get your ass out this car.
Shamu, what are you doing with those guns?
FUEISHA:
You're not gonna shoot me, are you?
Shit, I will.
Nobody gonna shot you, Fue.
FUEISHA:
You promise?
- - Yeah, man.
Hey, Shamu, we got to lose this shit, man.
All right, man, look.
Okay, look, Fue... what you're gonna do is you're gonna get out right here.
SHAMU:
Go home and tell nobody about this, okay?
About what?
Bitch, get your fat ass out the car!
I just need a ride...
down to the corner.
Shamu, we can't be carting' this pork-ass all around town.
All right, man, look.
We gonna ride down to the corner... and you gonna get out and go home and say nothing about this.
SHAMU:
Ah h-ite?
Say nothing about what?
All right.
Steady knocking Motherfuckers out
That's what it's all about
When I come to they'll probably Figure shit out
All on their own And I'm to break out
Thought they was in the zone And they've ground
Yes, sir
They say the sound of the stars Run a ring around the planets From Venus to Mars Who you looking for?
Damn, Fue.
Who are you looking for?
A white devil, little punk-ass snitch wearing a red lid, all right?
Lid?
Damn, niggah, a red hat!
I always leave one alive When I take out a tribe So they can walk on With details of my size Fire in his eyes
Like the one on that munchkin?
Yeah, just like the one on that munchkin.
Hey, yo. hey, yo!
Hey. yo. hey, yo, what?
JUNKSHOW:
Little man, step up.
- - That's the hat.
DOKE:
Do you trust these clowns?
- - I don't know, brother, ask him. DOKE:
Me, neither.
Yo, where'd you get that lid?
You mean my hat?
They were having a sale at Macy's.
JUNKSHOW:
Not the answer I was looking for, little man.
Chill out, homie.
I just picked it out of that trash can over there.
That can right there.
JUNKSHOW:
Good enough.
Let's roll.
Damn, you ate all those?
I love candy bars.
You know what, man?
Drop her fat ass off right here.
No, wait, give me a few more minutes.
Ain't nothing good gonna come from a few more minutes.
(MUSIC FADES UP)
FUEISHA:
So, who's Reggie?
JUNKSHOW:
What?
FUEISHA:
I heard you shout, "This is for Reggie."
Fue, how long have you lived in the hood, huh?
You don't know who Reggie is?
Reggie's about to get a life sentence.
Man, why the fuck we spilling this?
FUEISHA:
What'd he do?
Nothing!
All right, he didn't do nothing!
And that cracker is planning to ID him in court.
If he did nothing, why is he in court?
Oprah, chill with the interrogation.
You don't need to know Reggie's side of the story.
You just need to learn that in this world... your people stand up for they own.
FUEISHA:
Was he guilty?
SHAMU:
Does it matter?
FUEISHA:
So, he was, and this guy you're chasing, he's a witness?
He saw Reggie do it and now Reggie is facing time.
Yeah, snitching son of a bitch is walking around Reggie's neighborhood... with a shit-eating grin on his face.
Good as dead.
Well, how is this guy supposed to know where Reggie lives?
Dumb fucker better know where he live if he's gonna help put him behind bars.
You ever bit the inside of your cheek?
Have you?
Have I ever bit the inside of my cheek?
Not just bit, but accidentally chomped down on it really hard.
What the hell are you talking about?
Have you?
Yeah, that pain's the worst.
SHAMU:
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know that feeling, right after you do it?
That slow motion, wishful feeling that it didn't just happen?
FUEISHA:
You know what I'm talking about.
Then comes the real shit, the life swelling, eye-watering pain.
And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.
There's no going back and reliving that moment... or maybe just changing things a wee bit.
Damn right.
And the pain grows and it spreads and you squirm around.
Oh, you wish to God it didn't happen, but it did.
And now, you have to live with it.
But what really sucks is that this never happens on the last bite of your meal.
So, now the meal is ruined because your mouth is pulsing.
And then sudden jolts of reality runs through your mind.
This life will never allow you to go back and remove the pain.
It's all there.
We all gotta learn from it.
We all gotta learn to move on with it.
Yo, this shit is whack.
Why push the head at the speed of pain?
All of us, you, me, you.
That guy you're after.
No one alive can avoid it.
Now, look, I know you're pissed about Reggie.
But don't deal with pain by inflicting more.
Please, brothers, cause no more pain?
Yo, this is all insightful and shit... but sometimes things just have to be finished.
Well, thanks for setting me straight, but now I got myself a stomach ache.
From eating all that garbage.
Well, I ain't gonna go shoot the guy who sold them to me.
And do you know why?
Oh, here the fuck she go again.
'Cause I stole them candy bars.
Stole them, and now I'm paying for it.
They call that karma.
What the fuck you know about karma?
Not much, but I'm learning.
(BLUES ROCK)
It'd be real easy to take him out, man.
You hear me?
In Reggie's pain?
Or we just be keeping cool.
FUEISHA (V.O.):
Please, brothers, cause no more pain?
Yo.
I got him.
What you want to do?
( ENGINE STARTS )
( OMINOUS MUSIC )
That's him.
That's him, next light.
( SOFT MUSIC )
Ready?
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
SHAMU:
Don't do it, man.
You know, just scare him a little bit.
Make sure he know we know.
( NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
Don't know where Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
Some sunny day
We'll meet again Don't know when
Don't know where
Honey, I can't-- Are you able to pay for this?

I have the package.
You drive.
FUEISHA:
Is this your bike?
This is my bike.
Why?
Here.
You should have this.
Thank you.
(ROCK MUSIC FADES UP)
They say you have everything
But they don't see Behind closed doors
You smile And put on a show for them
But inside you're scared
You're crying
And it's lonely at the top
No one cares for you
They only see right through
And it's lonely at the top
You can't cuddle up with fame
Or hide when you're lost And it's lonely at the top Don't come down
You can't buy your way out Of the shades of gold
It'll crack your soul
When the crowd is here But you know who knows
Lonely at the top
You can't cuddle up with fame Or hide when you're lost And it's lonely at the top
