After pressing Ctrl+Alt+I, the KSIRC window will be activated, if it exists. Simple.

KSIRC
After pressing Alt+Ctrl+H the input of'Hello 'will be simulated, as if you typed it. This is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word (for instance, 'unsigned'). Every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ':'. Note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses, so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard. In the table below, the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type.\\ "enter" (i. e. new line) Enter or Return\ a (i. e. small a) A\ A (i. e. capital a) Shift+A\: (colon) Shift+;\ '' (space) Space
Type'Hello '
This action runs Konsole, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
Run Konsole
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.
Remap Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 in Qt Designer
By pressing Alt+Ctrl+W a D-Bus call will be performed that will show the minicli. You can use any kind of D-Bus call, just like using the command line'qdbus' tool.
Perform D-Bus call'kdesktop KDesktopIface popupExecuteCommand() '
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Just like the "Type'Hello'" action, this one simulates keyboard input, specifically, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+B, it sends B to XMMS (B in XMMS jumps to the next song). The'Send to specific window 'checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing'XMMS_Player' is specified; this will make the input always be sent to this window. This way, you can control XMMS even if, for instance, it is on a different virtual desktop.\\ (Run'xprop 'and click on the XMMS window and search for WM_CLASS to see'XMMS_Player').
Next in XMMS

Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

About Bug Reporting - Help
Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the KDE Bug Reports Database Site. All the information you enter on the bug report must be in English, if possible, as KDE is formed internationally.
What do you know about the crash?
In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed.
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type/ format (later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system, you can attach a file to the report)
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash information is not detailed enough, you may need to install some debug packages and reload it (if the Install Debug Symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information.)
You can find more information about backtraces, what they mean, and how they are useful at %1
Once you get a useful backtrace (or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages) you can continue.
Conclusions
Using the quality of the crash information gathered, and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Login into the bug tracking system
We may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information. As we need to keep track of the bug reports, you need to have an account on the KDE bug tracking system. If you do not have one, you can create one here: %1
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again.
List of possible duplicate reports
This page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug. If there are similar bug reports found, you can double click on them to see details. Then, read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar.
If you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported, you can set your information to be attached to the existing report.
If you are unsure whether your report is the same, follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report. This is usually the safest thing to do. We cannot uncombine bug reports, but we can easily merge them.
If not enough possible duplicates are found, or you did not find a similar report, then you can force it to search for more bug reports (only if the date range limit is not reached.)
If you do not find any related reports, your crash information is not useful enough, and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context, then it is better to not file the bug report, thereby closing the assistant.
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
The last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done. It will then show the web address of the bug report in the KDE bug tracking system, so that you can look at the report later.
If the process fails, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report again. If the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem, you can save it to a file to manually report later.
Thank you for being part of KDE!

& Overwrite
Unable to create a valid backtrace.
This backtrace appears to be of no use. This is probably because your packages are built in a way which prevents creation of proper backtraces, or the stack frame was seriously corrupted in the crash.
Loading backtrace...
The following options are enabled:
As the usage of these options is not recommended - because they can, in rare cases, be responsible for KDE problems - a backtrace will not be generated. You need to turn these options off and reproduce the problem again in order to get a backtrace.
Backtrace will not be created.
System configuration startup check disabled.
Do you want to generate a backtrace? This will help the developers to figure out what went wrong. Unfortunately this will take some time on slow machines. Note: A backtrace is not a substitute for a proper description of the bug and information on how to reproduce it. It is not possible to fix the bug without a proper description.

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.

The automatically started session will be locked immediately (provided it is a KDE session). This can be used to obtain a super-fast login restricted to one user.
Preselect User
Preselect the user that logged in previously. Use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user.
Select the user to be preselected for login. This box is editable, so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers.
Check all users you want to allow a password-less login for. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Miscellaneous
Logo area:
KDM - Dialog Here you can configure the basic appearance of the KDM login manager in dialog mode, i. e. a greeting string, an icon etc.
Here you can choose the language used by KDM. This setting does not affect a user's personal settings; that will take effect after login.
Appearance
You can choose a basic Color Scheme here that will be used by KDM only.
Fonts
This changes the font which is used for all the text in the login manager except for the greeting and failure messages.
This changes the font which is used for failure messages in the login manager.
This changes the font which is used for the login manager's greeting.
Allow Shutdown
& Local:
Everybody
Only Root
Nobody
Here you can select who is allowed to shutdown the computer using KDM. You can specify different values for local (console) and remote displays. Possible values are: Everybody: everybody can shutdown the computer using KDM Only root: KDM will only allow shutdown after the user has entered the root password Nobody: nobody can shutdown the computer using KDM
Commands
Command to initiate the system halt. Typical value: / sbin/ halt
Command to initiate the system reboot. Typical value: / sbin/ reboot
None
Enable boot options in the "Shutdown..." dialog.

Users
If this option is checked, KDM will show a list of users, so users can click on their name or image rather than typing in their login.
If this option is checked, KDM will automatically complete user names while they are typed in the line edit.
KDM will show all non-checked non-system users. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Here you can specify where KDM will obtain the images that represent users. "System" represents the global folder; these are the pictures you can set below. "User" means that KDM should read the user's $HOME/. face. icon file. The two selections in the middle define the order of preference if both sources are available.

Select whether realtime scheduling should be enabled for the application. The scheduler governs which process will run and which will have to wait. Two schedulers are available: Normal: This is the standard, timesharing scheduler. It will divide fairly the available processing time between all processes. Realtime: This scheduler will run your application uninterrupted until it gives up the processor. This can be dangerous. An application that does not give up the processor might hang the system. You need root's password to use the scheduler.

Killbots
Classic
The rules used in the original BSD command line version of robots. Nothing fancy, just the basic game elements: no fastbots, no safe teleports, no pushing junkheaps, and a huge game grid. Due to its larger width, it is recommended that you use a theme with narrower tiles to better fit your screen.
Daleks
An approximation of the rules used in Daleks, a robots-like game for early Apple computers. The hero is allotted one energy each round that can be used to power the sonic screwdriver. All other special features are disabled.
The default Killbots game type. Includes a medium size grid, safe teleports, fast enemies and pushable junkheaps.
Easy
An easier version of the "Killbots" game type. Includes a bigger game grid prepopulated with junkheaps, a starting stash of energy and an increasing energy cap.
Energy Crisis
The player starts with 30 energy and cannot earn more. How many rounds can you survive and how many points can you collect before your energy and luck run out?

Tutorial Course
Welcome to the tutorial course for Kolf!
To hit the ball, press and hold the Down Arrow or left mouse button. How long you hold down the mouse button or key determines strength of the shot.
To aim the putter, press the Left (rotate counterclockwise) and Right (rotate clockwise) Arrow keys or use the mouse.
Bridges Bridges can have walls on the top, bottom, left, or right.
Everything Here's a hole that has it all. Have fun with Kolf! -- Jason Katz-Brown
Slopes Slopes are slanted areas of ground that push the ball in the direction that they slope. This direction is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info.
Hit the ball onto the slope and let it roll into cup.
Try out these different types of slopes.
The steepness of a slope is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info. Steepness goes from 8 (steepest) to 1 (shallowest).
Walls Bounce the ball off of the red walls.
Sand Sand is yellow, and slows your ball down.
Puddles (Water) Hitting into a puddle (blue) adds a penalty stroke to your score, and your ball is placed outside the puddle.
Windmills Windmills (brown base with moving arm) have brown walls (or half walls). The speed of the windmill arm may vary for each hole.
Black Holes Black Holes transport the ball to their exit, and eject it at a speed in direct relation to the speed your ball was traveling. Choose Hole- > Show Info to see which Black Hole goes to which exit and the direction the ball will come out.
Floaters Floaters are moving platforms that carry a ball that lands on it. Floaters' speeds vary.

Ladder Pyramid
Three
Four
Seven
Eleven
The column to the left of the 1 requires a quick run down and back up, with careful dodging both ways to avoid the enemies. To get the gold in the middle of the 6, drop down on the top of the'O 'part of the 6, move right/ dig left and immediately move left and dig left to delay the enemy who otherwise is likely to catch you. However, you may wish to leave this piece of gold to the end so as not to free two additional enemies earlier; it is possible to get two enemies to retrap themselves in that section, though. To get the gold held by enemies in the bottom right, dig out the blocking square to their left, run up the ladder, dig off the right side of the 6, drop in, run left and dig off a square on the left side of the 6 and drop to the floor. The timing is tight - only one or two enemies in the bottom right section will be able to move to the next section to the left. You will still need to dig out the bottom of the 6 to get their gold, but that is straightforward albeit a bit hectic because of the enemies lingering to the left of the 6. Once you have gotten all the gold, you may find it easiest to exit by passing through the middle false floor on the 1 and exiting via the ladders on the left of the 1.
