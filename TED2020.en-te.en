A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. 
The idea is actually pretty simple. 
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. 
It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life. 
There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. 
The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable. 
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. 
And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. 
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. 
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. 
For fun! 
(Laughter) Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. 
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges. 
I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. 
Have you ever wanted to write a novel? 
Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days. 
It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. 
So I did. 
By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. 
You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel. 
Now is my book the next great American novel? 
No. I wrote it in a month. 
It's awful. 
(Laughter) But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, "I'm a computer scientist." 
No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist." 
(Laughter) So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. 
I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick. 
There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. 
In fact, they're a ton of fun. 
But they're less likely to stick. 
When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this. 
(Laughter) So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for? 
I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot! 
For the next 30 days. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared, but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this. 
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at. 
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me. 
(Laughter) What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. 
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS, the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict, and the Africa of disasters. 
While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. 
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why. 
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to. 
This is the Africa of opportunity. 
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. 
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today. 
And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa. 
On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria, was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. 
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family. 
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu. 
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London. 
Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where, according to our constitution, those in office as governors, president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened: people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office. 
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail. 
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders. 
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. 
And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa -- corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging. 
Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no. 
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there. 
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight. 
So when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. 
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go. 
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on. 
The results are showing: independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption, and governance is improving. 
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries. 
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. 
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption. 
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa. 
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption? 
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted? 
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. 
I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank, on asset recovery, trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back. 
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back, it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together. 
(Applause) The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform. 
Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care. 
We are grateful, but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. 
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. 
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start. 
We have to reform our economies, change our leadership, become more democratic, be more open to change and to information. 
And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria. 
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa. 
I want to tell you that. 
(Laughter) One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. 
(Laughter) What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves. 
And with the support of a leader who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program, which we developed ourselves. 
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president. 
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself. 
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in. 
The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent. 
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises. 
(Applause) We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets. 
Can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history? 
(Laughter) Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury. 
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe. 
You had to do everything to get your phone. 
When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting. 
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world, after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people. 
(Laughter) The smartest one, first to come in, was the MTN company of South Africa. 
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister, they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year. 
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country, with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita. 
So the market is there. 
When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know. 
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies, and three or four others have come in. 
But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know. 
So privatization is one of the things we've done. 
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. 
Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. 
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. 
So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price. 
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in, because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil. 
We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price. 
We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial. 
But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast. 
When they crashed, we crashed. 
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy. 
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves. 
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. 
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable. 
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy. 
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent. 
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now. 
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy. 
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. 
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. 
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction, and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out, the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous. 
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said. 
We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible, that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world. 
We have opportunities in housing and real estate. 
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping malls as you know them here. 
This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people. 
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected. 
So, huge things in construction, real estate, mortgage markets. Financial services: we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business. 
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital. 
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars. 
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside. 
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million. 
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million. 
And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system. 
We are doing the same with the insurance sector. 
So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity. 
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity. 
And that's what many people know East Africa for: the wildlife, the elephants, and so on. 
But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important. 
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. 
A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000, more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections. 
Not all of them have been perfect, or will be, but the trend is very clear. 
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years, the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum. 
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries. 
So it's clear that things are changing. 
Conflicts are down on the continent; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago, we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur. 
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affected. 
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries, not one country. 
And if we are down to three or four conflicts, it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. 
And I want to just make one point about this investment. 
The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet. 
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs. 
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. 
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. 
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go? 
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. 
(Applause) I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. 
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this. 
It says, "Africa: Open for Business." 
And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year. 
Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June. 
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class. 
One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi, making children's clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business. 
Mixing African materials, such as we have, with materials from elsewhere. 
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys, with African material mixed in. Very creative designs, has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart. 
(Laughter) For 10,000 pieces. 
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing. 
And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard. 
I could go on giving examples: Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her. 
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand, because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market. 
Nobody thinks there's opportunity. 
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever. 
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing. 
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world, who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income. 
So I invite you to explore the opportunities. 
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. 
This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. 
We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want. 
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. 
Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range. 
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. 
It's also very flexible architecture. 
This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data. 
This is "Bleak House" by Dickens. 
Every column is a chapter. 
To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture. 
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book. 
I wouldn't recommend it. 
This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian. 
Every large image is the beginning of a section. 
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium. 
We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. 
We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content. 
If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. 
Or other models, or even technical specifications. 
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. 
We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary. 
Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. 
And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. 
But those are all the roads in the U.S. 
superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. 
So let's pull up, now, something else. 
This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out. 
This is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies. 
One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. 
and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. 
And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. 
You can see that when we do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience. 
But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. 
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken. 
So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially. 
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. 
Some are much more spatial. 
I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets -- this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology, It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. 
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. 
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. 
You just type Notre Dame into Flickr, and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on. 
And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. 
And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. 
We can just navigate in this very simple way. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. 
It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. 
(Laughter) I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. 
If I can find some of the sort of weird ones -- So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on. 
Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go. 
This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. 
We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. 
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. 
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together. 
Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. 
You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. 
Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. 
And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. 
Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered. 
If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way. 
And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right? 
What your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together? 
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering, creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images. 
It's doing that based on the content inside the images. 
And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. 
Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. 
What if that picture links to all of your pictures? 
The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. 
It's a classic network effect. 
CA: Truly incredible. Congratulations. 

So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces. 
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. 
Hit me. 
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right? 
It's very flat, kind of rigid. 
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac, you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. 
I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing. 
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. 
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral -- you know, what's visible, what's not. 
And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop. 
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop. 
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. 
So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. 
And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull, things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk, I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. 
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. 
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? 
And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. 
Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that? 
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. 
Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought -- I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further? 
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. 
But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right? 
(Laughter) So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right? 
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. 
Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared, because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties. 
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. 
So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later. 
Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner. 
Also just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices. 
And I can pull them off when I want to work with them. 
So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer." 
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align, kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. 
More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. 
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. 
Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. 
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software -- I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs. 
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. 
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. 
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. 
So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know -- okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here, and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. 
And that's BumpTop. Thanks! 

Imagine waking up to a stranger -- sometimes multiple strangers -- questioning your right to existence for something that you wrote online, waking up to an angry message, scared and worried for your safety. 
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment. 
The kind of harassment that women face in Pakistan is very serious and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. 
This kind of harassment keeps women from accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. 
It's a form of oppression. 
Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world, with 140 million people having access to mobile technologies, and 15 percent internet penetration. 
And this number doesn't seem to go down with the rise of new technologies. 
Pakistan is also the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai. 
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. 
Another aspect is where the twisted concept of honor is linked to women and their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect women and even kill them sometimes in the name of so-called "family honor"; where women are left to die right outside their houses for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, in the name of "family honor." 
Let me say this very clearly: it's not honor; it's a cold-blooded murder. 
I come from a very small village in Punjab, Pakistan, where women are not allowed to pursue their higher education. 
The elders of my extended family didn't allow their women to pursue their higher education or their professional careers. 
However, unlike the other male guardians of my family, my father was one who really supported my ambitions. 
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, and [there were] frowns of disapproval. 
But in the end, I knew it's either me or them, and I chose myself. 
(Applause) My family's traditions and expectations for a woman wouldn't allow me to own a mobile phone until I was married. 
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool for my own surveillance. 
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah. 
And that was the time when I first asked myself, "Why? 
Why are women not allowed to enjoy the same equal rights enshrined in our Constitution? 
While the law states that a woman has the same equal access to the information, why is it always men -- brothers, fathers and husbands -- who are granting these rights to us, effectively making the law irrelevant?" 
So I decided to take a step, instead of keep questioning these patriarchal structures and societal norms. 
And I founded the Digital Rights Foundation in 2012 to address all the issues and women's experiences in online spaces and cyberharassment. 
From lobbying for free and safe internet to convincing young women that access to the safe internet is their fundamental, basic, human right, I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark to address the questions that have bothered me all these years. 
With a hope in my heart, and to offer a solution to this menace, I started Pakistan's and the region's first cyberharassment help line in December 2016 -- (Applause) to extend my support to the women who do not know who to turn to when they face serious threats online. 
I think of the women who do not have the necessary support to deal with the mental trauma when they feel unsafe in online spaces, and they go about their daily activities, thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box. 
Safe access to the internet is an access to knowledge, and knowledge is freedom. 
When I fight for women's digital rights, I'm fighting for equality. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries. 
Now I work in the solar technology industry. 
And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ... 
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing. 
It's just a quick video of what we do. 
Huh. Hang on a moment. 
It might take a moment to load. 
(Laughter) We'll just -- we can just skip -- I'll just skip through the video instead ... 
(Laughter) No. 
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Music) This is not ... 
(Laughter) Okay. 
(Laughter) Solar technology is ... 
Oh, that's all my time? 
Okay. Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. 
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate. 
I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject. 
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft. 
Now rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin, and then to Mars ... 
(Laughter) ... if we use pennies. 
Now this is obviously a powerful, some might say dangerously powerful, insight. 
But it's also a morally important one. 
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about, but this is actual economic losses. 
This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops, as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum. 
But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math. 
Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene. 
So that's a chunk of what we're looking for. 
But total movie revenues across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up. 
And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up. 
Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up. 
So this small missing chunk here is puzzling. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms, it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented, but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the 90's. 
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy. 
(Laughter) 50 billion dollars of it a year, which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone, that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. 
(Laughter) It's true. 
(Applause) I have Excel. 
(Laughter) The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft, which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people. 
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people. 
And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft, have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. 
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. 
And some people think that string theory is tough. 
(Laughter) Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. 
It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. 
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. 
Some people think this number's a little bit large, but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year. 
Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. 
And it was a big Christmas hit. 
Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket. 
(Laughter) (Applause) These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs, which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media. 
(Applause) Or about 75,000 jobs. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now you might find copyright math strange, but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. 
So that's it for now. 
I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you.

I am an immigrant from Uganda living in the United States while waiting for my asylum application to go through. 
Migrants do not enjoy much freedom of movement in our world today. 
This certainly applies to those who are desperate enough to navigate choppy and stormy seas in boats. 
These are the risks my cousins from West Africa and North Africa face while trying to cross over to Europe. 
Indeed, it is a rare but fortunate opportunity for a migrant to address a gathering like this. 
But this also signifies what often is missing in the global debate over refugees, migrants and immigrants, voices of the disenfranchised. 
Citizens of many host countries, even those that previously welcomed newcomers, are uneasy about the rising numbers of individuals coming into their countries. 
The immediate criticism is that the newcomers upend the stability of social welfare and employment in their countries. 
Uncertain and skeptical citizens look towards politicians who are competing against each other to see who can claim the prize of the loudest voice of populism and nationalism. 
It is a contest of who is the toughest on migrants, the most willing to impose travel bans and the most eager to propose projects in building walls. 
All these restrictions simply address symptoms of the problem, not the causes. 
Why are they coming? 
Migrants can share perspectives, if only politicians would be willing to listen. 
In Dubai, I chronicled injustices and inequalities inflicted regularly on the migrant labor force. 
As a result, pressures from the governments of the respective countries led to me being forced out of my career as a journalist in the Middle East. 
I was deported to Uganda, where economic deprivation puts everyone at the risk of starvation. 
I fled Uganda to come to the United States in the hope of sustaining a voice for my brothers and sisters who experience a more serious plight as migrants. 
My father told me he was not happy about me writing a book that risked deportation and unemployment. 
He had been diabetic for many years when I still worked in Dubai, and my salary was always sufficient to pay for his treatments. 
After I was expelled, I could not afford to sustain his treatment, and even in the last days of his life, I could not afford to take him to a hospital. 
As I carried his body in my hands to lay it in the ground in June of last year, I realized I had paid a profound price for amplifying my voice. 
The act of speaking up against injustices that are multilayered is never easy, because the problems require more than just rhetoric. 
So long as gold mines, oilfields and large farms in Africa continue to be owned by foreign investors and those vital resources are shipped to the West, the stream of African migrants will flow continuously. 
There are no restrictions that could ever be so rigorous to stop the wave of migration that has determined our human history. 
Before border controls can be tightened and new visa restrictions imposed, countries that have long received migrants should engage in a more open discussion. 
That is the only practical start for reconciling, finally, a legacy of exploitation, slavery, colonialism and imperialism, so that together, we can move forward in creating a more just global economy in the 21st century -- one that benefits all. 

At age four, I found a garden, living underneath the kitchen floor. 
It was hiding behind leftover patches of linoleum on the worn-out floor my mother was having removed. 
The workman was busy when the garden caught my attention. 
My eyes became glued to the patterns of embroidered roses blooming across my childhood landscape. 
I saw them and felt a sense of joy and adventure. 
This excitement felt like a feeling to go forward into something I knew nothing about. 
My passion and connection to garden started at that exact moment. 
When spring arrived, I ran so fast through the house, speeding ahead of my mother's voice. 
I pulled on my red corduroy jumper and my grey plaid wool hat before my mother could get her jacket on. 
I catapulted out of the front screen door and threw myself on a fresh carpet of grass. 
Excited, I bounced to my feet and flipped three more cartwheels before landing by her side. 
Mother dear was in the garden busy breaking up the soil, and I sat beside her, playing with mud pies in the flower bed. 
When her work was done, she rewarded me with an ice-cold glass of bittersweet lemonade and then lined my shoes with sprigs of mint to cool off my feet. 
My mother cooked with the colors and textures of her garden. 
She baked yams and squash and heirloom tomatoes and carrots. 
She fed love to a generation of people with purple hull peas and greens. 
It seems that during my childhood, the blooms from my mother's gardens have healed all the way from her halo to the roots on the soles of our feet. 
In our last conversation before her death, she encouraged me to go anywhere in the world that would make me happy. 
Since then, I have planted her gardens through art installations throughout the world, in countries of the people that I meet. 
Now they are lining parks and courtyards, painted on walls and even in blighted lots off the street. 
If you were in Berlin, Germany, you would have seen my garden at Stilwerk Design Center, where rosemary and lavender, hydrangea and lemon balm trailed up the glass elevators to all six floors. 
In 2009, I planted "Philosophers Garden," a garden mural, blooming at the historic Frederick Douglass High School in Memphis, Tennessee. 
This school’s garden fed an entire community and was honored by Eleanor Roosevelt during the Great Depression. 
Again, in 2011, I planted at Court Square Park -- six entry gardens with 80 varieties of deliciously fragrant floribunda and hybrid tea roses. 
Gardening has taught me that planting and growing a garden is the same process as creating our lives. 
This process of creation begins in the spring, when you break up the soil and start anew. 
Then it's time to clear out the dead leaves, debris and roots of the winter. 
The gardener must then make sure that a good disposition and the proper nutrients are correctly mixed in the soil. 
Then it's important to aerate the topsoil and leave it loosely packed on the surface. 
You won't get those beautiful blooms in life until you first do the work just right. 
When our gardens are balanced with care, we can harvest the beauty of living a life of grace. 
In the forests, when trees realize through their roots that another tree is sick, they will send a portion of their nutrients to that tree to help them to heal. 
They never think about what will happen to them or feel vulnerable when they do. 
When a tree is dying, it releases all of its nutrients to other trees that need it the most. 
Below the surface, we are all connected by our roots and sharing nutrients with each other. 
It's only when we come together that we can honestly grow. 
It's the same for humans in the garden of hardship. 
In this garden, when the caterpillar transforms into a chrysalis, this involves some struggle. 
But it's a challenge with a purpose. 
Without this painful fight to break free from the confines of the cocoon, the newly formed butterfly can't strengthen its wings. 
Without the battle, the butterfly dies without ever taking flight. 
My life's work is to illustrate how to integrate human connectivity into the garden. 
Gardens are full of magical wisdom for this transformation. 
Mother Nature is creative energy waiting to be born. 
Gardens are a mirror that cast their own reflection into our waking lives. 
So nurture your talents and strengths while you appreciate all you've been given. 
Remain humble to healing. 
And maintain compassion for others. 
Cultivate your garden for giving and plant those seeds for the future. 
The garden is the world living deep inside of you. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) 

"You don't belong here" almost always means, "We can't find a function or a role for you." 
"You don't belong here" sometimes means, "You're too queer to handle." 
"You don't belong here" very rarely means, "There's no way for you to exist and be happy here." 
I went to university in Johannesburg, South Africa, and I remember the first time a white friend of mine heard me speaking Setswana, the national language of Botswana. 
I was on the phone with my mother and the intrigue which painted itself across her face was absolutely priceless. 
As soon as I hung up, she comes to me and says, "I didn't know you could do that. 
After all these years of knowing you, how did I not know you could do that?" 
What she was referring to was the fact that I could switch off the twang and slip into a native tongue, and so I chose to let her in on a few other things which locate me as a Motswana, not just by virtue of the fact that I speak a language or I have family there, but that a rural child lives within this shiny visage of fabulosity. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I invited the Motswana public into the story, my story, as a transgender person years ago, in English of course, because Setswana is a gender-neutral language and the closest we get is an approximation of "transgender." 
And an important part of my history got left out of that story, by association rather than out of any act of shame. 
"Kat" was an international superstar, a fashion and lifestyle writer, a musician, theater producer and performer -- all the things that qualify me to be a mainstream, whitewashed, new age digestible queer. 
Kat. 
Kat had a degree from one of the best universities in Africa, oh no, the world. 
By association, what Kat wasn't was just like the little brown-skinned children frolicking through the streets of some incidental railway settlement like Tati Siding, or an off-the-grid village like Kgagodi, legs clad in dust stockings whose knees had blackened from years of kneeling and wax-polishing floors, whose shins were marked with lessons from climbing trees, who played until dusk, went in for supper by a paraffin lamp and returned to play hide-and-seek amongst centipedes and owls until finally someone's mother would call the whole thing to an end. 
That got lost both in translation and in transition, and when I realized this, I decided it was time for me to start building bridges between myselves. 
For me and for others to access me, I had to start indigenizing my queerness. 
What I mean by indigenizing is stripping away the city life film that stops you from seeing the villager within. 
In a time where being brown, queer, African and seen as worthy of space means being everything but rural, I fear that we're erasing the very struggles that got us to where we are now. 
The very first time I queered being out in a village, I was in my early 20s, and I wore a kaftan. 
I was ridiculed by some of my family and by strangers for wearing a dress. 
My defense against their comments was the default that we who don't belong, the ones who are better than, get taught, we shrug them off and say, "They just don't know enough." 
And of course I was wrong, because my idea of wealth of knowledge was based in removing yourself from Third World thinking and living. 
But it took time for me to realize that my acts of pride weren't most alive in the global cities I traipsed through, but in the villages where I speak the languages and play the games and feel most at home and I can say, "I have seen the world, and I know that people like me aren't alone here, we are everywhere." 
And so I used these village homes for self-reflection and to give hope to the others who don't belong. 
Indigenizing my queerness means bridging the many exceptional parts of myself. 
It means honoring the fact that my tongue can contort itself to speak the romance languages without denying or exoticizing the fact that when I am moved, it can do this: (Ululating) It means -- (Cheers) (Applause) It means branding cattle with my mother or chopping firewood with my cousins doesn't make me any less fabulous or queer, even though I'm now accustomed to rooftop shindigs, wine-paired menus and VIP lounges. 
(Laughter) It means wearing my pride through my grandmother's tongue, my mother's food, my grandfather's song, my skin etched with stories of falling off donkeys and years and years and years of sleeping under a blanket of stars. 
If there's any place I don't belong, it's in a mind where the story of me starts with the branch of me being queer and not with my rural roots. 
Indigenizing my queerness means understanding that the rural is a part of me, and I am an indelible part of it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Cello music starts) You found me, you found me under a pile of broken memories with your steady, steady love. 
You rocked me, you rocked me, you rocked me all through the night with your steady, steady love. 
(Cello music continues) (Taps rhythmically) You found me, you found me under a pile of broken memories with your steady, your steady, steady love. 
And you rocked me, you rocked me, you rocked me all through the night with your steady, steady, steady love. 
(Music ends) (Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching. 
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. 
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests. 
I gave out homework assignments. 
When the work came back, I calculated grades. 
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. 
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. 
And that got me thinking. 
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. 
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. 
After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. 
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. 
But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? 
So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. 
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? 
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. 
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. 
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. 
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? 
We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? 
And who's going to earn the most money? 
In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. 
And it wasn't social intelligence. 
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. 
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. 
Grit is having stamina. 
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. 
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. 
A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. 
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. 
Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. 
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. 
It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. 
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it. 
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build grit in kids? 
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? 
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?" 
The honest answer is, I don't know. 
(Laughter) What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. 
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. 
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. 
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset." 
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. 
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. 
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. 
But we need more. 
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. 
That's the work that stands before us. 
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. 
We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. 
In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. 
(Applause) 

I think we're all aware that the world today is full of problems. 
We've been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades. 
Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems. 
Poor nutrition, access to water, climate change, deforestation, lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food, not enough healthcare, pollution. 
There's problem after problem, and I think what really separates this time from any time I can remember in my brief time on Earth is the awareness of these problems. 
We're all very aware. 
Why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems? 
That's the question I've been struggling with, coming from my very different perspective. 
I'm not a social problem guy. 
I'm a guy that works with business, helps business make money. 
God forbid. 
So why are we having so many problems with these social problems, and really is there any role for business, and if so, what is that role? 
I think that in order to address that question, we have to step back and think about how we've understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face. 
Now, I think many have seen business as the problem, or at least one of the problems, in many of the social challenges we face. 
You know, think of the fast food industry, the drug industry, the banking industry. 
You know, this is a low point in the respect for business. 
Business is not seen as the solution. 
It's seen as the problem now, for most people. 
And rightly so, in many cases. 
There's a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing, that actually have made the problem worse. 
So this perspective is perhaps justified. 
How have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems, these many issues that we face in society? 
Well, we've tended to see the solutions in terms of NGOs, in terms of government, in terms of philanthropy. 
Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs and social organizations. 
This is a unique, new organizational form that we've seen grown up. 
Enormous innovation, enormous energy, enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges. 
And many of us here are deeply involved in that. 
I'm a business school professor, but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits. 
Whenever I got interested and became aware of a societal problem, that was what I did, form a nonprofit. 
That was the way we've thought about how to deal with these issues. 
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way. 
But I think at this moment, we've been at this for quite a while. 
We've been aware of these problems for decades. 
We have decades of experience with our NGOs and with our government entities, and there's an awkward reality. 
The awkward reality is we're not making fast enough progress. 
We're not winning. 
These problems still seem very daunting and very intractable, and any solutions we're achieving are small solutions. 
We're making incremental progress. 
What's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems? 
If we cut all the complexity away, we have the problem of scale. 
We can't scale. 
We can make progress. We can show benefits. 
We can show results. We can make things better. 
We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good. 
We can't scale. 
We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems. 
Why is that? 
Because we don't have the resources. 
And that's really clear now. 
And that's clearer now than it's been for decades. 
There's simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model. 
There's not enough tax revenue, there's not enough philanthropic donations, to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now. 
We've got to confront that reality. 
And the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing, certainly in the advanced world today, with all the fiscal problems we face. 
So if it's fundamentally a resource problem, where are the resources in society? 
How are those resources really created, the resources we're going to need to deal with all these societal challenges? 
Well there, I think the answer is very clear: They're in business. 
All wealth is actually created by business. 
Business creates wealth when it meets needs at a profit. 
That's how all wealth is created. 
It's meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations. 
That's where all the resources come from. 
Only business can actually create resources. 
Other institutions can utilize them to do important work, but only business can create them. 
And business creates them when it's able to meet a need at a profit. 
The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business. 
The question then is, how do we tap into this? 
How do we tap into this? 
Business generates those resources when it makes a profit. 
That profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they're trying to solve. 
But that profit is the magic. 
Why? Because that profit allows whatever solution we've created to be infinitely scalable. 
Because if we can make a profit, we can do it for 10, 100, a million, 100 million, a billion. 
The solution becomes self-sustaining. 
That's what business does when it makes a profit. 
Now what does this all have to do with social problems? 
Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit and redeploy it into social problems. 
Business should give more. 
Business should be more responsible. 
And that's been the path that we've been on in business. 
But again, this path that we've been on is not getting us where we need to go. 
Now, I started out as a strategy professor, and I'm still a strategy professor. 
I'm proud of that. 
But I've also, over the years, worked more and more on social issues. 
I've worked on healthcare, the environment, economic development, reducing poverty, and as I worked more and more in the social field, I started seeing something that had a profound impact on me and my whole life, in a way. 
The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually, there's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance. 
The conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem. 
The classic example is pollution. 
If business pollutes, it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution. 
Reducing pollution is expensive, therefore businesses don't want to do it. 
It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment. 
It's too expensive to have a safe working environment, therefore business makes more money if they don't have a safe working environment. 
That's been the conventional wisdom. 
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom. 
They resisted environmental improvement. 
They resisted workplace improvement. 
That thinking has led to, I think, much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business, that I come to criticize in business. 
But the more deeply I got into all these social issues, one after another, and actually, the more I tried to address them myself, personally, in a few cases, through nonprofits that I was involved with, the more I found actually that the reality is the opposite. 
Business does not profit from causing social problems, actually not in any fundamental sense. 
That's a very simplistic view. 
The deeper we get into these issues, the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems. 
That's where the real profit comes. 
Let's take pollution. 
We've learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit. 
It saves money. 
It makes the business more productive and efficient. 
It doesn't waste resources. 
Having a safer working environment actually, and avoiding accidents, it makes the business more profitable, because it's a sign of good processes. 
Accidents are expensive and costly. 
Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn that actually there's no trade-off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense. 
Another issue is health. 
I mean, what we've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure, because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent. 
The deeper work, the new work, the new thinking on the interface between business and social problems is actually showing that there's a fundamental, deep synergy, particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run. 
In the very short run, you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there's fundamentally opposing goals, but in the long run, ultimately, we're learning in field after field that this is simply not true. 
So how could we tap into the power of business to address the fundamental problems that we face? 
Imagine if we could do that, because if we could do it, we could scale. 
We could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity. 
And guess what? That's happening now, finally, partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade. 
We see organizations like Dow Chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products. 
This is an example of Jain Irrigation. 
This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers, reducing substantially the use of water. 
We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria that's figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees. 
You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually, yes, be responsible, but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business. 
There's a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems, and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business. 
And the question is, how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value? 
This is what I call shared value: addressing a social issue with a business model. 
That's shared value. 
Shared value is capitalism, but it's a higher kind of capitalism. 
It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be, meeting important needs, not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share. 
Shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously. 
It's finding those opportunities that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale. 
We can address shared value at multiple levels. 
It's real. It's happening. 
But in order to get this solution working, we have to now change how business sees itself, and this is thankfully underway. 
Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom that they shouldn't worry about social problems, that this was sort of something on the side, that somebody else was doing it. 
We're now seeing companies embrace this idea. 
But we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have NGOs and government working in partnership with business. 
The new NGOs that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships, that have found these ways to collaborate. 
The governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots. 
And government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way. 
I think if we can get business seeing itself differently, and if we can get others seeing business differently, we can change the world. 
I know it. I'm seeing it. 
I'm feeling it. 
Young people, I think, my Harvard Business School students, are getting it. 
If we can break down this sort of divide, this unease, this tension, this sense that we're not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems, we can break this down, and we finally, I think, can have solutions. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm here to tell you not just my story but stories of exceptional women from India whom I've met. 
They continue to inspire me, teach me, guide me in my journey of my life. 
These are incredible women. 
They never had an opportunity to go to school, they had no degrees, no travel, no exposure. 
Ordinary women who did extraordinary things with the greatest of their courage, wisdom and humility. 
These are my teachers. 
For the last three decades, I've been working, staying and living in India and working with women in rural India. 
I was born and brought up in Mumbai. 
When I was in college, I met Jayaprakash Narayan, famous Gandhian leader who inspired youth to work in rural India. 
I went into the villages to work in rural India. 
I was part of land rights movement, farmers' movement and women's movement. 
On the same line, I ended up in a very small village, fell in love with a young, handsome, dynamic young farmer-leader who was not very educated, but he could pull the crowd. 
And so in the passion of youth, I married him and left Mumbai, and went to a small village which did not have running water and no toilet. 
Honestly, my family and friends were horrified. 
(Laughter) I was staying with my family, with my three children in the village, and one day, a few years later one day, a woman called Kantabai came to me. 
Kantabai said, "I want to open a saving account. 
I want to save." 
I asked Kantabai: "You are doing business of blacksmith. 
Do you have enough money to save? 
You are staying on the street. 
Can you save?" 
Kantabai was insistent. 
She said, "I want to save because I want to buy a plastic sheet before the monsoons arrive. 
I want to save my family from rain." 
I went with Kantabai to the bank. 
Kantabai wanted to save 10 rupees a day -- less than 15 cents. 
Bank manager refused to open the account of Kantabai. 
He said Kantabai's amount is too small and it's not worth his time. 
Kantabai was not asking any loan from the bank. 
She was not asking any subsidy or grant from the government. 
What she was asking was to have a safe place to save her hard-earned money. 
And that was her right. 
And I went -- I said if banks are not opening the account of Kantabai, why not start the bank which will give an opportunity for women like Kantabai to save? 
And I applied for the banking license to Reserve Bank of India. 
(Applause) No, it was not an easy task. 
Our license was rejected -- (Laughter) on the grounds -- Reserve Bank said that we cannot issue a license to the bank whose promoting members who are nonliterate. 
I was terrified. 
I was crying. 
And by coming back home, I was continuously crying. 
I told Kantabai and other women that we couldn't get the license because our women are nonliterate. 
Our women said, "Stop crying. 
We will learn to read and write and apply again, so what?" 
(Applause) We started our literacy classes. 
Every day our women would come. 
They were so determined that after working the whole day, they would come to the class and learn to read and write. 
After five months, we applied again, but this time I didn't go alone. 
Fifteen women accompanied me to Reserve Bank of India. 
Our women told the officer of Reserve Bank, "You rejected the license because we cannot read and write. 
You rejected the license because we are nonliterate." 
But they said, "There were no schools when we were growing, so we are not responsible for our noneducation." 
And they said, "We cannot read and write, but we can count." 
(Laughter) (Applause) And they challenged the officer. 
"Then tell us to calculate the interest of any principal amount." 
(Laughter) "If we are unable to do it, don't give us license. 
Tell your officers to do it without a calculator and see who can calculate faster." 
(Applause) Needless to say, we got the banking license. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Today, more than 100,000 women are banking with us and we have more than 20 million dollars of capital. 
This is all women's savings, women capital, no outside investors asking for a business plan. 
No. 
It's our own rural women's savings. 
(Applause) I also want to say that yes, after we got the license, today Kantabai has her own house and is staying with her family in her own house for herself and her family. 
(Applause) When we started our banking operations, I could see that our women were not able to come to the bank because they used to lose the working day. 
I thought if women are not coming to the bank, bank will go to them, and we started doorstep banking. 
Recently, we starting digital banking. 
Digital banking required to remember a PIN number. 
Our women said, "We don't want a PIN number. 
That's not a good idea." 
And we tried to explain to them that maybe you should remember the PIN number; we will help you to remember the PIN number. 
They were firm. 
They said, "suggest something else," and they -- (Laughter) and they said, "What about thumb?" 
I thought that's a great idea. 
We'll link that digital banking with biometric, and now women use the digital financial transaction by using the thumb. 
And you know what they said? 
They said, "Anybody can steal my PIN number and take away my hard-earned money, but nobody can steal my thumb." 
(Applause) That reinforced the teaching which I have always learned from women: never provide poor solutions to poor people. 
They are smart. 
(Applause) A few months later, another woman came to the bank -- Kerabai. 
She mortgaged her gold and took the loan. 
I asked Kerabai, "Why are you mortgaging your precious jewelry and taking a loan?" 
Kerabai said, "Don't you realize that it's a terrible drought? 
There's no food or fodder for the animals. 
No water. 
I'm mortgaging gold to buy food and fodder for my animals." 
And then she asks me, "Can I mortgage gold and get water?" 
I had no answer. 
Kerabai challenged me: "You're working in the village with women and finance, but what if one day there's no water? 
If you leave this village, with whom are you going to do banking?" 
Kerabai had a valid question, so in this drought, we decided to start the cattle camp in the area. 
It's where farmers can bring their animals to one place and get fodder and water. 
It didn't rain. 
Cattle camp was extended for 18 months. 
Kerabai used to move around in the cattle camp and sing the songs of encouragement. 
Kerabai became very popular. 
It rained and cattle camp was ended, but after cattle camp ended, Kerabai came to our radio -- we have community radio which has more than 100,000 listeners. 
She said, "I want to have a regular show on the radio." 
Our radio manager said, "Kerabai, you cannot read and write. 
How will you write the script?" 
You know what she replied? 
"I cannot read and write, but I can sing. 
What's the big deal?" 
(Laughter) And today, Kerabai is doing a regular radio program, and not only that, she's become a famous radio jockey and she has been invited by all of the radios, even from Mumbai. 
She gets the invitation and she does the show. 
(Applause) Kerabai has become a local celebrity. 
One day I asked Kerabai, "How did you end up singing?" 
She said, "Shall I tell you the real fact? 
When I was pregnant with my first child, I was always hungry. 
I did not have enough food to eat. 
I did not have enough money to buy food, and so to forget my hunger, I started singing." 
So strong and wise, no? 
I always think that our women overcome so many obstacles -- cultural, social, financial -- and they find out their ways. 
I would like to share another story: Sunita Kamble. 
She has taken a course in a business school, and she has become a veterinary doctor. 
She's Dalit; she comes from an untouchable caste, but she does artificial insemination in goats. 
It is a very male-dominated profession and it is all the more difficult for Sunita because Sunita comes from an untouchable caste. 
But she worked very hard. 
She did successful goat deliveries in the region and she became a famous goat doctor. 
Recently, she got a national award. 
I went to Sunita's house to celebrate -- to congratulate her. 
When I entered the village, I saw a big cutout of Sunita. 
Sunita was smiling on that picture. 
I was really surprised to see an untouchable, coming from the village, having a big cutout at the entrance of the village. 
When I went to her house, I was even more amazed because upper caste leaders -- men -- were sitting in the house, in her house, and having chai and water, which is very rare in India. 
Upper caste leaders do not go to an untouchable's house and have chai or water. 
And they were requesting her to come and address the gathering of the village. 
Sunita broke centuries-old caste conditioning in India. 
(Applause) Let me come to what the younger generations do. 
As I'm standing here -- I'm so proud as I stand here, from Mhaswad to Vancouver. 
Back home, Sarita Bhise -- she's not even 16 years old. 
She's preparing herself -- she's a part of our sports program, Champions' program. 
She's preparing herself to represent India in field hockey. 
And you know where she's going? 
She's going to represent in 2020 Olympics, Tokyo. 
(Applause) Sarita comes from a very poor shepherd community. 
I am just -- I couldn't be more proud of her. 
There are millions of women like Sarita, Kerabai, Sunita, who can be around you also. 
They can be all over the world, but at first glance you may think that they do not have anything to say, they do not have anything to share. 
You would be so wrong. 
I am so lucky that I'm working with these women. 
They are sharing their stories with me, they are sharing their wisdom with me, and I'm just lucky to be with them. 
20 years before -- and I'm so proud -- we went to Reserve Bank of India and we set up the first rural women's bank. 
Today they are pushing me to go to National Stock Exchange to set up the first fund dedicated to micro rural women entrepreneurs. 
They are pushing me to set up the first small finance women's bank in the world. 
And as one of them said, "My courage is my capital." 
And I say here, their courage is my capital. 
And if you want, it can be yours also. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

The power of yet. 
I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate, and if they didn't pass a course, they got the grade "Not Yet." 
And I thought that was fantastic, because if you get a failing grade, you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere. 
But if you get the grade "Not Yet", you understand that you're on a learning curve. 
It gives you a path into the future. 
"Not Yet" also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career, a real turning point. 
I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty, so I gave 10-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. 
Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way. 
They said things like, "I love a challenge," or, "You know, I was hoping this would be informative." 
They understood that their abilities could be developed. 
They had what I call a growth mindset. 
But other students felt it was tragic, catastrophic. 
From their more fixed mindset perspective, their intelligence had been up for judgment, and they failed. 
Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet, they were gripped in the tyranny of now. 
So what do they do next? 
I'll tell you what they do next. 
In one study, they told us they would probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they failed a test. 
In another study, after a failure, they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves. 
And in study after study, they have run from difficulty. 
Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error. 
On the left, you see the fixed-mindset students. 
There's hardly any activity. 
They run from the error. 
They don't engage with it. 
But on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset, the idea that abilities can be developed. 
They engage deeply. 
Their brain is on fire with yet. 
They engage deeply. 
They process the error. 
They learn from it and they correct it. 
How are we raising our children? 
Are we raising them for now instead of yet? 
Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting As? 
Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams? 
Their biggest goal is getting the next A, or the next test score? 
And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives? 
Maybe, because employers are coming to me and saying, "We have already raised a generation of young workers who can't get through the day without an award." 
So what can we do? 
How can we build that bridge to yet? 
Here are some things we can do. 
First of all, we can praise wisely, not praising intelligence or talent. 
That has failed. 
Don't do that anymore. 
But praising the process that kids engage in, their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their improvement. 
This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient. 
There are other ways to reward yet. 
We recently teamed up with game scientists from the University of Washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet. 
In this game, students were rewarded for effort, strategy and progress. 
The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right, right now, but this game rewarded process. 
And we got more effort, more strategies, more engagement over longer periods of time, and more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems. 
Just the words "yet" or "not yet," we're finding, give kids greater confidence, give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence. 
And we can actually change students' mindsets. 
In one study, we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult, the neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections, and over time, they can get smarter. 
Look what happened: In this study, students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition, but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades. 
We have shown this now, this kind of improvement, with thousands and thousands of kids, especially struggling students. 
So let's talk about equality. 
In our country, there are groups of students who chronically underperform, for example, children in inner cities, or children on Native American reservations. 
And they've done so poorly for so long that many people think it's inevitable. 
But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet, equality happens. 
And here are just a few examples. 
In one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York scored in the 95th percentile on the national achievement test. 
Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school. 
In one year, fourth-grade students in the South Bronx, way behind, became the number one fourth-grade class in the state of New York on the state math test. 
In a year, to a year and a half, Native American students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district to the top, and that district included affluent sections of Seattle. 
So the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids. 
This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed. 
Before, effort and difficulty made them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up, but now, effort and difficulty, that's when their neurons are making new connections, stronger connections. 
That's when they're getting smarter. 
I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy. 
He said, "Dear Professor Dweck, I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research, and that's why I decided to put it into practice. 
I put more effort into my schoolwork, into my relationship with my family, and into my relationship with kids at school, and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas. 
I now realize I've wasted most of my life." 
Let's not waste any more lives, because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth, it becomes a basic human right for children, all children, to live in places that create that growth, to live in places filled with "yet". 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today, I am going to talk about anger. 
When I was 11, seeing some of my friends leaving the school because their parents could not afford textbooks made me angry. 
When I was 27, hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was about to be sold to a brothel made me angry. 
At the age of 50, lying on the street, in a pool of blood, along with my own son, made me angry. 
Dear friends, for centuries we were taught anger is bad. 
Our parents, teachers, priests -- everyone taught us how to control and suppress our anger. 
But I ask why? 
Why can't we convert our anger for the larger good of society? 
Why can't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world? 
That I tried to do. 
Friends, most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger. 
Like when I was 35 and sat in a locked-up, tiny prison. 
The whole night, I was angry. 
But it has given birth to a new idea. 
But I will come to that later on. 
Let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself. 
I had been a big admirer of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood. 
Gandhi fought and lead India's freedom movement. 
But more importantly, he taught us how to treat the most vulnerable sections, the most deprived people, with dignity and respect. 
And so, when India was celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birth centenary in 1969 -- at that time I was 15 -- an idea came to my mind. 
Why can't we celebrate it differently? 
I knew, as perhaps many of you might know, that in India, a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste. 
And they are treated as untouchables. 
These are the people -- forget about allowing them to go to the temples, they cannot even go into the houses and shops of high-caste people. 
So I was very impressed with the leaders of my town who were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of Gandhian ideals. 
So inspired by that, I thought, let us set an example by inviting these people to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community. 
I went to some low-caste, so-called untouchable, people, tried to convince them, but it was unthinkable for them. 
They told me, "No, no. It's not possible. It never happened." 
I said, "Look at these leaders, they are so great, they are against untouchability. 
They will come. If nobody comes, we can set an example." 
These people thought that I was too naive. 
Finally, they were convinced. 
My friends and I took our bicycles and invited political leaders. 
And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered to see that each one of them agreed to come. 
I thought, "Great idea. We can set an example. 
We can bring about change in the society." 
The day has come. 
All these untouchables, three women and two men, they agreed to come. 
I could recall that they had used the best of their clothes. 
They brought new utensils. 
They had taken baths hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do. 
It was the moment of change. 
They gathered. Food was cooked. 
It was 7 o'clock. 
By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting, because it's not very uncommon that the leaders become late, for an hour or so. 
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes, just to remind them. 
One of the leader's wives told me, "Sorry, he is having some headache, perhaps he cannot come." 
I went to another leader and his wife told me, "Okay, you go, he will definitely join." 
So I thought that the dinner will take place, though not at that large a scale. 
I went back to the venue, which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park. 
It was 10 o'clock. 
None of the leaders showed up. 
That made me angry. 
I was standing, leaning against Mahatma Gandhi's statue. 
I was emotionally drained, rather exhausted. 
Then I sat down where the food was lying. 
I kept my emotions on hold. 
But then, when I took the first bite, I broke down in tears. 
And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. 
And it was the healing, motherly touch of an untouchable woman. 
And she told me, "Kailash, why are you crying? 
You have done your bit. 
You have eaten the food cooked by untouchables, which has never happened in our memory." 
She said, "You won today." 
And my friends, she was right. 
I came back home, a little after midnight, shocked to see that several high-caste elderly people were sitting in my courtyard. 
I saw my mother and elderly women were crying and they were pleading to these elderly people because they had threatened to outcaste my whole family. 
And you know, outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of. 
Somehow they agreed to punish only me, and the punishment was purification. 
That means I had to go 600 miles away from my hometown to the River Ganges to take a holy dip. 
And after that, I should organize a feast for priests, 101 priests, wash their feet and drink that water. 
It was total nonsense, and I refused to accept that punishment. 
How did they punish me? 
I was barred from entering into my own kitchen and my own dining room, my utensils were separated. 
But the night when I was angry, they wanted to outcaste me. 
But I decided to outcaste the entire caste system. 
(Applause) And that was possible because the beginning would have been to change the family name, or surname, because in India, most of the family names are caste names. 
So I decided to drop my name. 
And then, later on, I gave a new name to myself: Satyarthi, that means, "seeker of truth." 
(Applause) And that was the beginning of my transformative anger. 
Friends, maybe one of you can tell me, what was I doing before becoming a children's rights activist? 
Does anybody know? 
No. 
I was an engineer, an electrical engineer. 
And then I learned how the energy of burning fire, coal, the nuclear blast inside the chambers, raging river currents, fierce winds, could be converted into the light and lives of millions. 
I also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy could be harnessed for good and making society better. 
So I'll come back to the story of when I was caught in the prison: I was very happy freeing a dozen children from slavery, handing them over to their parents. 
I cannot explain my joy when I free a child. 
I was so happy. 
But when I was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown, Delhi, I saw that dozens of children were arriving; they were being trafficked by someone. 
I stopped them, those people. 
I complained to the police. 
So the policemen, instead of helping me, they threw me in this small, tiny shell, like an animal. 
And that was the night of anger when one of the brightest and biggest ideas was born. 
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 children, and 50 more will join, that's not done. 
And I believed in the power of consumers, and let me tell you that this was the first time when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world, to educate and sensitize the consumers to create a demand for child-labor-free rugs. 
In Europe and America, we have been successful. 
And it has resulted in a fall in child labor in South Asian countries by 80 percent. 
(Applause) Not only that, but this first-ever consumer's power, or consumer's campaign has grown in other countries and other industries, maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond. 
My anger at the age of 11, when I realized how important education is for every child, I got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children. 
I created a book bank at the age of 11. 
But I did not stop. 
Later on, I cofounded the world's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the Global Campaign for Education. 
That has helped in changing the whole thinking towards education from the charity mode to the human rights mode, and that has concretely helped the reduction of out-of-school children by half in the last 15 years. 
(Applause) My anger at the age of 27, to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel, has given me an idea to go for a new strategy of raid and rescue, freeing children from slavery. 
And I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or 10 or 20, but my colleagues and I have been able to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers. 
(Applause) I knew that we needed global policies. 
We organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in a new international convention to protect the children who are in the worst forms. 
And the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down by one third in the last 15 years. 
(Applause) So, in each case, it began from anger, turned into an idea, and action. 
So anger, what next? 
Idea, and -- Audience: Action Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action. Which I tried to do. 
Anger is a power, anger is an energy, and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never be vanished, can never be destroyed. 
So why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world, a more just and equitable world? 
Anger is within each one of you, and I will share a secret for a few seconds: that if we are confined in the narrow shells of egos, and the circles of selfishness, then the anger will turn out to be hatred, violence, revenge, destruction. 
But if we are able to break the circles, then the same anger could turn into a great power. 
We can break the circles by using our inherent compassion and connect with the world through compassion to make this world better. 
That same anger could be transformed into it. 
So dear friends, sisters and brothers, again, as a Nobel Laureate, I am urging you to become angry. 
I am urging you to become angry. 
And the angriest among us is the one who can transform his anger into idea and action. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: For many years, you've been an inspiration to others. 
Who or what inspires you and why? 
KS: Good question. 
Chris, let me tell you, and that is the truth, each time when I free a child, the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother, the first smile of freedom, and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter can ever come back and sit in her lap, they become so emotional and the first tear of joy rolls down on her cheek, I see the glimpse of God in it -- this is my biggest inspiration. 
And I am so lucky that not once, as I said before, but thousands of times, I have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Music) These bees are in my backyard in Berkeley, California. 
Until last year, I'd never kept bees before, but National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them, and I decided, to be able to take compelling images, I should start keeping bees myself. 
And as you may know, bees pollinate one third of our food crops, and lately they've been having a really hard time. 
So as a photographer, I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like. 
So I'm going to show you what I found over the last year. 
This furry little creature is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell, and bees right now are dealing with several different problems, including pesticides, diseases, and habitat loss, but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia, Varroa destructor. 
And this pinhead-sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood. 
This eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees, and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease. 
Now, bees are the most sensitive when they're developing inside their brood cells, and I wanted to know what that process really looks like, so I teamed up with a bee lab at U.C. Davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera. 
I'm going to show you the first 21 days of a bee's life condensed into 60 seconds. 
This is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva, and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them. 
Then, their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae. 
Here's that same pupation process, and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells. 
Then the tissue in their body reorganizes and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes. 
The last step of the process is their skin shrivels up and they sprout hair. 
(Music) So -- (Applause) As you can see halfway through that video, the mites were running around on the baby bees, and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with chemicals. 
In the long run, that's bad news, so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites. 
This is one of those alternatives. 
It's an experimental breeding program at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge, and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program. 
Now, the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites, so they set out to breed a line of mite-resistant bees. 
This is what it takes to breed bees in a lab. 
The virgin queen is sedated and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument. 
Now, this procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed, but there's a tradeoff in having this much control. 
They succeeded in breeding mite-resistant bees, but in that process, those bees started to lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey, so to overcome that problem, these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers. 
This is Bret Adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives. 
He and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world, and the USDA is integrating their mite-resistant bees into his operation with the hope that over time, they'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite-resistant but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us. 
And to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees, and the truth is, we've been doing that for thousands of years. 
We took this wild creature and put it inside of a box, practically domesticating it, and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey, but over time we started losing our native pollinators, our wild pollinators, and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination demands of our agriculture, so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system. 
So when people talk about saving bees, my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees, and in order to design new solutions, we have to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see. 
In other words, we have to understand bees up close. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When I was growing up, I really liked playing hide-and-seek a lot. 
One time, though, I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot, but I fell and broke my arm. 
I actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso. 
It was taken off six weeks later, but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow, and I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it, 100 times per day, seven days per week. 
I barely did it, because I found it boring and painful, and as a result, it took me another six weeks to get better. 
Many years later, my mom developed frozen shoulder, which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder. 
The person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food. 
She went each week to physical therapy, but just like me, she barely followed the home treatment, and it took her over five months to feel better. 
Both my mom and I required physical therapy, a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury. 
At first, a physical therapist works with patients, but then it's up to the patients to do their exercises at home. 
But patients find physical therapy boring, frustrating, confusing and lengthy before seeing results. 
Sadly, patient noncompliance can be as high as 70 percent. 
This means the majority of patients don't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better. 
All physical therapists agree that special exercises reduce the time needed for recovery, but patients lack the motivation to do them. 
So together with three friends, all of us software geeks, we asked ourselves, wouldn't it be interesting if patients could play their way to recovery? 
We started building MIRA, A P.C. software platform that uses this Kinect device, a motion capture camera, to transform traditional exercises into video games. 
My physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy. 
Let's see how this looks. 
The first game asks me to fly a bee up and down to gather pollen to deposit in beehives, all while avoiding the other bugs. 
I control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion, just like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off. 
When designing a game, we speak to physical therapists at first to understand what movement patients need to do. 
We then make that a video game to give patients simple, motivating objectives to follow. 
But the software is very customizable, and physical therapists can also create their own exercises. 
Using the software, my physical therapist recorded herself performing a shoulder abduction, which is one of the movements my mom had to do when she had frozen shoulder. 
I can follow my therapist's example on the left side of the screen, while on the right, I see myself doing the recommended movement. 
I feel more engaged and confident, as I'm exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me. 
This basically extends the application for physical therapists to create whatever exercises they think are best. 
This is an auction house game for preventing falls, designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance. 
As a patient, I need to do sit and stand movements, and when I stand up, I bid for the items I want to buy. 
(Laughter) In two days, my grandmother will be 82 years old, and there's a 50 percent chance for people over 80 to fall at least once per year, which could lead to a broken hip or even worse. 
Poor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls, so reversing these problems through targeted exercise will help keep older people like my grandmother safer and independent for longer. 
When my schedule ends, MIRA briefly shows me how I progressed throughout my session. 
I have just shown you three different games for kids, adults and seniors. 
These can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients, but we'll soon have options for children with autism, mental health or speech therapy. 
My physical therapist can go back to my profile and see the data gathered during my sessions. 
She can see how much I moved, how many points I scored, with what speed I moved my joints, and so on. 
My physical therapist can use all of this to adapt my treatment. 
I'm so pleased this version is now in use in over 10 clinics across Europe and the U.S., and we're working on the home version. 
We want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment and help patients play their way to recovery at home. 
If my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy, then we would have been more successful following the treatment, and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me what hardware is this that they're rapidly putting away? 
What is that made of, and how much does it cost? 
Cosmin Milhau: So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo, but you just need a computer and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars. 
TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing that people use for their Xboxes to do 3D games, right? 
CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox, you only need a camera. 
TR: Right, so this is less than a $1,000 solution. 
CM: Definitely, 400 dollars, you can definitely use it. 
TR: So right now, you're doing clinical trials in clinics. 
CM: Yes. 
TR: And then the hope is to get it so it's a home version and I can do my exercise remotely, and the therapist at the clinic can see how I'm doing and stuff like that. 
CM: Exactly. 
TR: Cool. Thanks so much. CM: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri. 
Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. 
So I'll read it to you. 
She entitled her poem "I'll Marry When I Want." 
(Laughter) "I'll marry when I want. 
My mother can't force me to marry. 
My father cannot force me to marry. 
My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. 
No one in the world can force me to marry. 
I'll marry when I want. 
Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. 
I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. 
I'll marry when I want." 
This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. 
I am from Malawi. 
Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. 
Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. 
I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. 
I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. 
These girls grew up under the same roof. 
They were eating the same food. 
Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. 
But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. 
The other girl is my little sister. 
My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. 
It's a hurtful thing. 
Not only did it hurt her, even me. 
I was going through a hard time as well. 
As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go to initiation camps. 
In these initiation camps, you are taught how to sexually please a man. 
There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. 
Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. 
Most girls end up pregnant. 
They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. 
For my little sister, she ended up being pregnant. 
Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. 
Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. 
On the other side, there is this girl. 
She's amazing. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. 
She's very fabulous. 
That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go to the initiation camp. 
I was like, "What? 
I'm not going to go to the initiation camps." 
You know what the women said to me? 
"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. 
You do not respect the traditions of our society, of our community." 
I said no because I knew where I was going. 
I knew what I wanted in life. 
I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. 
I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. 
I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. 
Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. 
And I knew that one day, I would contribute something, a little something to my community. 
But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby. 
What about you?" 
That was the music that I was hearing every day, and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don't do something that the community needs them to do. 
When I compared the two stories between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? 
Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time in our community?" 
That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write. 
I said, "Come on, we can remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen, how to read, to hold the book." 
It was a great time I had with them. 
Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. 
That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers, our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" 
It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. 
A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. 
So we tried. 
It was very hard, but we pushed. 
And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. 
(Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. 
We did not stop there. 
We forged ahead. 
We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community, but even in other communities. 
When the child marriage bill was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. 
Every day, when the members of Parliament were entering, we were telling them, "Would you please support the bill?" 
And we don't have much technology like here, but we have our small phones. 
So we said, "Why can't we get their numbers and text them?" 
So we did that. It was a good thing. 
(Applause) So when the bill passed, we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." 
(Laughter) And when the bill was signed by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. 
Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal marriage age, from 15 to 18. 
(Applause) It's a good thing to know that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18 is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries of women and girls every day? 
Every day, girls' lives are being wasted away. 
This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment. 
In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues at heart every time. 
We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women, as we are in this room, we are not just women, we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. 
We can do more. 
And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced? 
The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there, they need to be publicized at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. 
Girls face issues, difficult issues, at the community level every day. 
So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them. 
And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. 
Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. 
It's a collective work. 
What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all, not to marry whilst 11. 
And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. 
I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation. 
This is the moment where a girl and a girl, and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) 

What if you could take a pill or a vaccine and, just like getting over a cold, you could heal your wounds faster? 
Today, if we have an operation or an accident, we're in the hospital for weeks, and often left with scars and painful side effects of our inability to regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. 
I work to create materials that instruct our immune system to give us the signals to grow new tissues. 
Just like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease, we could instead instruct our immune system to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds. 
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic, but there are several organisms that can achieve this feat. 
Some lizards can regrow their tails, the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm, and even us mere humans can regrow our liver after losing more than half of its original mass. 
To make this magic a bit closer to reality, I'm investigating how our body can heal wounds and build tissue through instructions from the immune system. 
From a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection, our immune system defends our body from danger. 
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know about our body's defense system, I was able to identify key players in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises. 
When looking at materials that are currently being tested for their abilities to help regrow muscle, our team noticed that after treating an injured muscle with these materials, there was a large number of immune cells in that material and the surrounding muscle. 
So in this case, instead of the immune cells rushing off towards infection to fight bacteria, they're rushing toward an injury. 
I discovered a specific type of immune cell, the helper T cell, was present inside that material that I implanted and absolutely critical for wound healing. 
Now, just like when you were a kid and you'd break your pencil and try and tape it back together again, we can heal, but it might not be in the most functional way, and we'll get a scar. 
So if we don't have these helper T cells, instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops fat cells inside of it, and if there's fat in our muscle, it isn't as strong. 
Now, using our immune system, our body could grow back without these scars and look like what it was before we were even injured. 
I'm working to create materials that give us the signals to build new tissue by changing the immune response. 
We know that any time a material is implanted in our body, the immune system will respond to it. 
This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps to the materials that engineers are using to try and build new tissue. 
So when I place that material, or scaffold, in the body, the immune system creates a small environment of cells and proteins that can change the way that our stem cells behave. 
Now, just like the weather affects our daily activities, like going for a run or staying inside and binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix, the immune environment of a scaffold affects the way that our stem cells grow and develop. 
If we have the wrong signals, say the Netflix signals, we get fat cells instead of muscle. 
These scaffolds are made of a variety of different things, from plastics to naturally derived materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, sponges that are more or less porous, gels of different stiffnesses. 
And researchers can even make the materials release different signals over time. 
So in other words, we can orchestrate this Broadway show of cells by giving them the correct stage, cues and props that can be changed for different tissues, just like a producer would change the set for "Les Mis" versus "Little Shop of Horrors." 
I'm combining specific types of signals that mimic how our body responds to injury to help us regenerate. 
In the future, we could see a scar-proof band-aid, a moldable muscle filler or even a wound-healing vaccine. 
Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow and be able to heal like Wolverine. 
Probably not next Tuesday, either. 
But with these advances, and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal wounds, we could begin seeing products on the market that work with our body's defense system to help us regenerate, and maybe one day be able to keep pace with a salamander. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I love infographics. 
As an information designer, I've worked with all sorts of data over the past 25 years. 
I have a few insights to share, but first: a little history. 
Communication is the encoding, transmission and decoding of information. 
Breakthroughs in communication mark turning points in human culture. 
Oracy, literacy and numeracy were great developments in communication. 
They allow us to encode ideas into words and quantities into numbers. 
Without communication, we'd still be stuck in the Stone Ages. 
Although humans have been around for a quarter million years, it was only 8,000 years ago that proto-writings began to surface. 
Nearly 3,000 years later, the first proper writing systems took shape. 
Maps have been around for millennia and diagrams for hundreds of years, but representing quantities through graphics is a relatively new development. 
It wasn't until 1786 that William Playfair invented the first bar chart, giving birth to visual display of quantitative information. 
Fifteen years later, he introduced the first pie and area charts. 
His inventions are still the most commonly used chart forms today. 
Florence Nightingale invented the coxcomb in 1857 for a presentation to Queen Victoria on troop mortality. 
Highlighted in blue, she showed how most troops' deaths could have been prevented. 
Shortly after, Charles Minard charted Napoleon's march on Moscow, illustrating how an army of 422,000 dwindled to just 10,000 as battles, geography and freezing temperatures took their toll. 
He combined a Sankey diagram with cartography and a line chart for temperature. 
I get excited when I get lots of data to play with, especially when it yields an interesting chart form. 
Here, Nightingale's coxcomb was the inspiration to organize data on thousands of federal energy subsidies, scrutinizing the lack of investment in renewables over fossil fuels. 
This Sankey diagram illustrates the flow of energy through the US economy, emphasizing how nearly half of the energy used is lost as waste heat. 
I love it when data can be sculpted into beautiful shapes. 
Here, the personal and professional connections of the women of Silicon Valley can be woven into arcs, same as the collaboration of inventors birthing patents across the globe can be mapped. 
I've even made charts for me. 
I'm a numbers person, so I rarely win at Scrabble. 
I made this diagram to remember all the two- and three-letter words in the official Scrabble dictionary. 
(Laughter) Knowing these 1,168 words certainly is a game changer. 
(Laughter) Sometimes I produce code to quickly generate graphics from thousands of data points. 
Coding also enables me to produce interactive graphics. 
Now we can navigate information on our own terms. 
Exotic chart forms certainly look cool, but something as simple as a little dot may be all you need to solve a particular thinking task. 
In 2006, the "New York Times" redesigned their "Markets" section, cutting it down from eight pages of stock listings to just one and a half pages of essential market data. 
We listed performance metrics for the most common stocks, but I wanted to help investors see how the stocks are doing. 
So I added a simple little dot to show the current price relative to its one-year range. 
At a glance, value investors can pick out stocks trading near their lows by looking for dots to the left. 
Momentum investors can find stocks on an upward trajectory via dots to the right. 
Shortly after, the "Wall Street Journal" copied the design. 
Simplicity is often the goal for most graphics, but sometimes we need to embrace complexity and show large data sets in their full glory. 
Alec Gallup, the former chairman of the Gallup Organization, once handed me a very thick book. 
It was his family's legacy: hundreds of pages covering six decades of presidential approval data. 
I told him the entire book could be graphed on a single page. 
"Impossible," he said. 
And here it is: 25,000 data points on a single page. 
At a glance, one sees that most presidents start with a high approval rating, but few keep it. 
Events like wars initially boost approval; scandals trigger declines. 
These major events were annotated in the graphic but not in the book. 
The point is, graphics can transmit data with incredible efficiency. 
Graphicacy -- the ability to read and write graphics -- is still in its infancy. 
New chart forms will emerge and specialized dialects will evolve. 
Graphics that help us think faster or see a book's worth of information on a single page are the key to unlocking new discoveries. 
Our visual cortex was built to decode complex information and is a master at pattern recognition. 
Graphicacy enables us to harness our built-in GPU to process mountains of data and find the veins of gold hiding within. 
Thank you. 
(Applause and cheers) 

So, as a child, I used to spend all of my time at my great-grandmother's house. 
On hot, humid, summer days, I would dash across the floor and stick my face in front of her only air conditioner. 
But I didn't realize that that simple experience, though brief, was a privileged one in our community. 
Growing up, stories of next-door neighbors having to set up fake energy accounts or having to steal energy seemed normal to me. 
During the winter, struggling to get warm, my neighbors would have no choice but to bypass the meter after their heat was shut off, just to keep their family comfortable for one more day. 
These kinds of dangerous incidents can take root when people are faced with impossible choices. 
In the US, the average American spends three percent of their income on energy. 
In contrast, low-income and rural populations can spend 20, even 30 percent of their income on energy. 
In 2015, this caused over 25 million people to skip meals to provide power to their homes. 
This is when energy becomes a burden. 
But energy burdens are so much more than just a number. 
They present impossible and perilous choices: Do you take your child to get her flu medicine, or do you feed her? 
Or do you keep her warm? 
It's an impossible choice, and nearly every month, seven million people choose between medicine and energy. 
This exposes a much larger and systemic issue. 
Families with high energy burdens are disproportionately people of color, who spend more per square foot than their white counterparts. 
But it's also nurses, veterans and even schoolteachers who fall into the mass of 37 million people a year who are unable to afford energy for their most basic needs. 
As a result, those with high energy burdens have a greater likelihood of conditions like heart disease and asthma. 
Look -- given our rockets to Mars and our pocket-sized AI, we have the tools to address these systemic inequities. 
The technology is here. 
Cost of renewables, insulation, microgrids and smart home technology are all decreasing. 
However, even as we approach cost parity, the majority of those who own solar earn much more than the average American. 
This is why, when I was 22, I founded the nonprofit RETI. 
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities, utilities and government agencies alike to provide equitable access to clean energy, energy efficiency and energy technology. 
But there's no one way to solve this. 
I believe in the power of local communities, in the transforming effect of relationships. 
So we start by working directly with the communities that have the highest energy burdens. 
We host workshops and events for communities to learn about energy poverty, and how making even small updates to their homes like better insulation for windows and water heaters can go a long way to maximize efficiency. 
We're connecting neighborhoods to community solar and spearheading community-led smart home research and installation programs to help families bring down their energy bills. 
We're even working directly with elected officials, advocating for more equitable pricing, because to see this vision of energy equity and resilience succeed, we have to work together sustainably. 
Now, the US spends over three billion a year on energy bill payment assistance. 
And these programs do help millions of people, but they're only able to help a fraction of those in need. 
In fact, there is a 47-billion-dollar home-energy affordability gap, so assistance alone is not sustainable. 
But by building energy equity and resilience into our communities, we can assure fair and impartial access to energy that is clean, reliable and affordable. 
At scale, microgrid technology, clean technology and energy efficiency dramatically improve public health. 
And for those with high energy burdens, it can help them reclaim 20 percent of their income -- 20 percent of a person's income who's struggling to make ends meet. 
This is life-changing. 
This is an opportunity for families to use their energy savings to sponsor their future. 
I think back to my great-grandmother and her neighbors, the impossible choices that they had to make and the effect it had on our whole community. 
But this is not just about them. 
There are millions nationwide having to make the same impossible choices today. 
And I know high energy burdens are a tremendous barrier to overcome, but through relationships with communities and technology, we have the paths to overcome them. 
And when we do, we will all be more resilient. 
Thank you. 

What do you do when you have a headache? 
You swallow an aspirin. 
But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is, it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first. 
Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body. 
The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. 
And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients. 
When they take their anti-HIV drugs, these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood, and increasing the CD4 cell counts. 
But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects, but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood, and worse, by the time they get to the sites where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs. 
These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes, the nervous system, as well as the lungs -- where the virus is sleeping, and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy. 
However, upon discontinuation of therapy, the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood. 
Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment, which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients. 
One day, I sat and thought, "Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites, without the risk of drug dilution?" 
As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes: Lasers, of course. 
If they can be used for dentistry, for diabetic wound-healing and surgery, they can be used for anything imaginable, including transporting drugs into cells. 
As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes, which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells, in order to deliver drugs within them. 
"How is that possible?" you may ask. 
Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug. 
The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. 
Before you even know it, the induced hole becomes immediately repaired. 
Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes, but the goal is to get this technology in the human body, apply it in the human body. 
"How is that possible?" you may ask. 
Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device. 
Using the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incision in the site of infection. 
Using the second head, which is a camera, we meander to the site of infection. 
Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler, we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection, while the laser is again used to poke those cells open. 
Well, this might not seem like much right now. 
But one day, if successful, this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. 
Yes. A cure for HIV. 
This is every HIV researcher's dream -- in our case, a cure lead by lasers. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

You know, my friends, I look at this photograph and I have to ask myself, you know, I think I've seen this somewhere before. 
People marching in the street for justice. 
But I know it's not the same photograph that I would have seen, because I wouldn't take my oath to be a police officer until 1989. 
And I've been in the business for over 25 years. 
And identifying as an African-American woman, I know things have gotten better. 
But even as I learned about public safety, I wondered if what I was doing on the street was hurting or harming the community. 
And I often wondered if, you know, how did they perceive me, this woman in uniform? 
But there is one thing that I knew. 
I knew there was a way that we could do this, probably, different or better. 
A way that preserved dignity and guaranteed justice. 
But I also knew that police could not do it alone. 
It's the coproduction of public safety. 
There is a lot of history with us. 
You know, we know loss. 
The relationship between the African American community and the police is a painful one. 
Often filled with mistrust. 
It has been studied by social scientists, it has been studied by government, all both promising, you know, hopeful new ways and long-term fixes. 
But all we want is to be safe. 
And our safety is intertwined. 
And that we know, in order to have great relationships and relationships built on trust, that we're going to have to have communication. 
And in this advent and this text of the world that we've got going on, trying to do this with social media, it's a very difficult thing to do. 
We also have to examine our current policing practices, and we have to set those things aside that no longer serve us. 
So, in New York, that meant "stop, question and frisk." 
That meant really holding up the numbers as opposed to relationships. 
And it really didn't allow the officers the opportunity to get to know the community in which they serve. 
But you see, there is a better way. 
And we know -- it's called coproduction. 
So in the 1970s, Elinor Ostrom came up with this theory, really called coproduction, and this is how it works. 
You bring people into the space that come with separate expertise, and you also come with new ideas and lived experience, and you produce a new knowledge. 
And when you produce that new knowledge, and you apply this theory to public safety, you produce a new type of public safety. 
And so, in New York, it feels like this. 
It is called building relationships, literally one block at a time. 
And it's "Build the Block." 
So this is how it works. 
You go to buildtheblock.nyc, you put in your address. 
And up pops location, date and time of your neighborhood meeting. 
The important part of this is you've got to go to the meeting. 
And once you go to that meeting, there, of course, will be NYPD, along with officers and other community members. 
What's important about bringing, now, the lived experience into this space to produce new knowledge is that we have to have a new way of delivering it. 
So the new way of delivering it is through what we call neighborhood coordinating officers, or NCOs. 
And so, also in this meeting are the NCOs, the what we call 911 response cars, sector cars, detectives, all of us working together to collaborate in this new way to reduce crime. 
And what's interesting about this is that we know that it works. 
So, for example, in Washington Heights. 
At a community meeting, there was a bar, up in Washington Heights, and the neighbors were complaining about outcry and noises. 
So in their conversations with their NCO, they talked about, you know, sound barriers, different ways to sort of approach this. 
Is there a different way we can direct traffic? 
And of course now they have relatively quieter bar nights. 
So, another issue that always comes up in neighborhoods is speeding. 
How many of you in here have ever had a speeding ticket? 
Raise your hand. 
Oh, higher, come on! 
There's more than that, this is New York. 
So those are other issues that brought to the NCO. 
Speeding -- what the NCOs do is they collaborate with the Department of Transportation, they look at issues such as speed bumps and signage and all types of things. 
And when we come together to create this different type of policing, it also feels different. 
The coproduction of public safety also means that officers need to understand the history and the power of their uniforms. 
They're going to have to set aside old historical narratives that do not serve them well. 
And that means they have to learn about implicit bias. 
Implicit biases are shortcuts the brain makes without us really knowing it. 
They're stereotypes that often influence our decision making. 
And so, you can imagine, for police officers who have to make split-second decisions can be a very detrimental decision-making point. 
That's why the NYPD, along with other departments throughout the United States, are training all of their officers in implicit bias. 
They have to understand that learning about their implicit biases, having good training, tactics and deescalation and understanding how it impacts your decision making makes us all safer. 
We also know how officers are treated inside the organization impacts how they're going to behave with the community at large. 
This is critical. 
Especially if you want to have a new way forward. 
And we know that we have to care for those folks that are on the frontline. 
And they have to recognize their own trauma. 
And in order to do that, us as leaders have to lift them up and let them know that the narratives of being strong men and women -- you can set those aside, and it's OK to say you need help. 
And we do that by providing peer support, employee assistance, mental health services. 
We make sure all of those things are in place, because without it -- it's a critical component to the coproduction of public safety. 
Equally as important is that we also have social issues that are often laid at the feet of law enforcement. 
So, for example, mental health and education. 
Historically, we've been pulled into those spaces where we have not necessarily provided public safety but have enforced long, historical legislative racial desegregation. 
We have to own our part in history. 
But we also have to have those folks at the table when we're talking about how do we move forward with coproduction. 
But understanding this, we also have to understand that we need to have voices come to us in a different way. 
We also have to recognize that the community may not be willing or ready to come to the table to have the conversation. 
And that's OK. 
We have to be able to accept that. 
By acknowledging it, it also means that we care for the community's health and for their resiliency as well. 
That's another key component. 
We also have to acknowledge that there are those folks that are in our community that are here -- they do want to do us harm. 
We also have to recognize that we have community members who did not get the benefits of a long-ago dream. 
We also have to acknowledge that we have put faith in a system that sometimes is broken, hoping that it would give us solutions for better. 
But we cannot walk away. 
Because there is a better way. 
And we know this because the NYPD's neighborhood policing philosophy is grounded in the coproduction of public safety. 
And in order for us to move forward together, with our family, our friends and for our health, we have to make sure that we focus this way. 
And in order to do that, there are three fundamental ideologies that we must all agree to. 
Are you ready? 
Oh, I'm sorry, one more time -- are you ready? 
Audience: Yes! 
Tracie Keesee: Now, that's better, alright. 
The first one: There's no more wallowing in the why. 
We know why. 
We must move forward together. There's no more us versus them. 
Number two: We must embrace the lived experience and our histories, and we must make sure we never go back to a place where we cannot move forward. 
And number three: We must also make sure that truth and telling facts is painful. 
But we also know that no action is no longer acceptable. 
And agree? 
Audience: Yes. 
TK: Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you, do you agree? 
Audience: Yes! 
TK: So we do know there is a better way. 
And the better way is the coproduction of public safety. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

In the year 1901, a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt. 
Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life. 
Her doctor was called Alois. 
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste, but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906. 
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain -- the likes of which he'd never seen before. 
Now here's the even more striking thing. 
If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago. 
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer. 
And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease. 
Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly. 
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV, statins for heart disease and much more. 
But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. 
I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade. 
So I think about this all the time. 
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide. 
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people -- which, by the way, will include many of you. 
If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older, your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two. 
In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's. 
Already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year. 
One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's. 
It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages. 
It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation. 
But we've done relatively little to address it. 
Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down. 
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it. 
The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer. 
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness. 
Because here's what few people know but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it. 
For most of the past 114 years, everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging. 
We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old. 
But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease. 
As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal. 
Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago. 
For almost a century, we didn't know much about these. 
Today we know they're made from protein molecules. 
You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami. 
There are spots on the paper that are sticky. 
And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside. 
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside. 
This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other, forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles. 
That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. 
We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works. 
There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex -- like defusing a bomb. 
Cutting one wire might do nothing. 
Cutting others might make the bomb explore. 
We have to find the right step to block, and then create a drug that does it. 
Until recently, we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best. 
But now we've got together a diverse group of people -- medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians. 
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease. 
Now let me show you some of our latest results. 
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet. 
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms. 
So these are healthy worms, and you can see they're moving around normally. 
These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules sticking together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer's. 
And you can see they're clearly sick. 
But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan. 
This is just an initial positive result, but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure. 
After 114 years of waiting, there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years. 
But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help. 
This isn't about scientists like me -- it's about you. 
We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try, we can beat it. 
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and regulators. 
That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s. 
Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer. 
But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves. 
And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day, are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change. 
So, it really is down to you. 
Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease. 
Everyone with a brain is at risk. 
Today, there are 40 million patients like Auguste, who can't create the change they need for themselves. 
Help speak up for them, and help demand a cure. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When I was raising investment for my startup, a venture capitalist said to me, "Ashwini, I think you're going to raise a few million dollars. 
And your company -- it's going to sell for 50 to 70 million. 
You're going to be really excited. 
Your early investors are going to be really excited. 
And I'm going to be really upset. 
So I'm not going to invest in this deal." 
I remember just being dumbstruck. 
Who would be unhappy with putting four or five million dollars into a company and having it sell for 50 to 70 million? 
I was a first-time founder. 
I didn't have a wealthy network of individuals to turn to for investment, so I went to venture capitalists the most common form of investor in a technology company. 
But I'd never taken the time to understand what was motivating that VC to invest. 
I believe we're living in a golden era of entrepreneurship. 
There is more opportunity to build companies than ever before. 
But the financial systems designed to fund that innovation, venture capital, they haven't evolved in the past 20 to 30 years. 
Venture capital was designed to pour large sums of money into a small number of companies that can sell for over a billion dollars. 
It was not designed to sprinkle capital across many companies that have the potential to succeed but for less, like my own. 
That limits the number of ideas that get funded, the number of companies that are created and who can actually receive that funding to grow. 
And I think it inspires a tough question: What's our goal with entrepreneurship? 
If our goal is to create a tiny number of billion-dollar companies, let's stick with venture capital, it's working. 
But if our goal is to inspire innovation and empower more people to build companies of all sizes, we need a new way to fund those ideas. 
We need a more flexible system that doesn't squeeze entrepreneurs and investors into one rigid financial outcome. 
We need to democratize access to capital. 
In the summer of 2017, I went out to San Francisco, to join a tech accelerator with 30 other companies. 
The accelerator was supposed to teach us how to raise venture capital. 
But when I got out there, the startup community was buzzing about ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings. 
For the first time, ICOs had raised more money for young startups than venture capital had. 
It was the first week of the program. 
Tequila Friday. 
And the founders couldn't stop talking. 
"I'm going to raise an ICO." 
"I'm going to raise an ICO." 
Until one guy goes, "How cool if we did this all together? 
We should do an ICO that combines the value of all of our companies and raise money as a group." 
At that point, I had to ask the obvious question, "Guys, what's an ICO?" 
ICOs were a way for young companies to raise money by issuing a digital currency tied to the value and services that the company provides. 
The currency acts similar to shares in a company, like on the public stock market, increasing in value as it's traded online. 
Most important, ICOs expanded the investor pool, from a few hundred venture capital firms to millions of everyday people, excited to invest. 
This market represented more money. 
It represented more investors. 
Which meant a greater likelihood to get funded. 
I was sold. 
The idea, though, of doing it together still seemed a little crazy. 
Startups compete with each other for investment, it takes hundreds of meetings to get a check. 
That I would spend my precious 15 minutes in front of an investor talking not just about my own company, but all the companies in the batch, was unprecedented. 
But the idea caught on. 
And we decided to cooperate, rather than compete. 
Every company put 10 percent of their equity into a communal pool that we then split into tradable cryptocurrency that investors could buy and sell. 
Six months and four law firms later -- (Laughter) in January 2018, we launched the very first ICO that represented the value of nearly 30 companies and an entirely new way to raise capital. 
We got a lot of press. 
My favorite headline about us read, "VCs, read this and weep." 
(Laughter) Our fund was naturally more diverse. 
Twenty percent of the founders were women. 
Fifty percent were international. 
The investors were more excited, too. 
They had a chance to get better returns, because we took out the middleman fees of venture capital. 
And they could take their money and reinvest it, potentially funding more new ideas faster. 
I believe this creates a virtuous cycle of capital that allows many more entrepreneurs to succeed. 
Because access to capital is access to opportunity. 
And we have only just begun to imagine what democratizing access to capital will do. 
I would have never thought that my own search for funding would lead me to this stage, having helped nearly 30 companies get investment. 
Imagine if other entrepreneurs tried to invent new ways to access capital rather than following the traditional route. 
It would change what gets built, who builds it and the long-term impact on the economy. 
And I believe that's way more exciting than just trying to invest in the next billion-dollar startup. 
Thank you.

I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver. 
There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light. 
And you may wonder, what's the point? 
And the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" -- tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet. 
In my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy-neutral. 
This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible. 
And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in. 
I demonstrated for the first time, at TED in 2011, Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity. 
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast, and also in a safe and secure manner. 
Data is transported by the light, encoded in subtle changes of the brightness. 
If we look around, we have many LEDs around us, so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us. 
But so far, we have been using special devices -- small photo detectors, to receive the information encoded in the data. 
I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li-Fi lights. 
And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels. 
A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy. 
This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone. 
But now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED, so if the incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the solar cell. 
This means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light and by the solar cell, because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted. 
Of course the question is: can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness, such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights? 
And the answer to that is yes, we can. 
We have shown in the lab that we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell. 
And this is faster than most broadband connections these days. 
Now let me show you in practice. 
In this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp. 
This is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell; it is connected to the laptop. 
And also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell. 
And this instrument shows something at the moment. 
This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light. 
Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light, and I'll simply, only switch on the light, for a moment, and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right. 
So the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source. 
If I turn it off, we see it drops. 
I turn it on ... 
So we harvest energy with the solar cell. 
But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video. 
And I've done this by pressing this button. 
So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way, and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye, because the changes are too fast to recognize. 
But in order to prove the point, I can block the light of the solar cell. 
So first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. 
If I remove the blockage, the video will restart. 
(Applause) And I can repeat that. 
So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well. 
So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver. 
But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog. 
And so I want to simulate fog, and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me. 
(Laughter) And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell. 
First you notice the energy harvested drops, as expected, but now the video still continues. 
This means, despite the blockage, there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition video. 
What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device. 
That's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post. 
And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell. 
And the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows, solar cells integrated into street furniture, or indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the Internet of Things. 
Because simply, we don't want to charge these devices regularly, or worse, replace the batteries every few months. 
As I said to you, this is the first time I've shown this in public. 
It's very much a lab demonstration, a prototype. 
But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. 
And we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide, and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet. 
And all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption -- because of the solar cells, quite the opposite. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

It was April 8, 2003. 
I was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq. 
That day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad. 
We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel, and, as happens in war, the fighting began to approach outside our windows. 
Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil. 
It smelled awful. 
Of course, I was supposed to be writing an article, but that's how it always goes -- you're supposed to be writing and something big happens. 
So I was in my room on the 16th floor, writing and looking out the window every now and then to see what was happening. 
Suddenly, there was a huge explosion. 
During the previous three weeks, there had been shelling with half-ton missiles, but this time, the shock -- I felt it inside of me, and I thought, "It's very close. 
It's very, very close." 
So I went down to see what was happening. 
I went down to the 15th floor to take a look. 
And I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways. 
I walked into a room and realized that it had been hit by a missile. 
Someone had been wounded. 
There was a man near the window, a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk, lying face-down. 
Having worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out. 
So I turned him over. 
And when I turned him over, I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis, but I couldn't see anything, nothing at all. 
All I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me, and I didn't understand what was going on. 
Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound, which was very serious, my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him, and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors. 
We put him in a car that took him to the hospital. 
He died on the way to the hospital. 
The Spanish cameraman José Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit -- because the shell had exploded between the two floors -- died on the operating table. 
As soon as the car left, I went back. 
There was that article I was supposed to write -- which I had to write. 
And so -- I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood, when one of the hotel gofers stopped me and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days. 
I told him to get lost. 
And I said to myself: "Clear your head, put it all aside. 
If you want to write, you need to put it all aside." 
And that's what I did. 
I went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off. 
Later, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues, something else was bothering me. 
I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot, and I couldn't understand what it meant. 
And then, the war was over. 
Later, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened." 
Because it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me. 
I have seen things like that happen to others in my 20 to 35 years of reporting. 
I have seen things that had an effect on me too. 
For example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon, a 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years -- a real veteran -- who we would follow everywhere. 
He would crawl in the dark with confidence -- he was a great soldier, a true soldier -- so we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him. 
And one day, as I was told -- and I've seen him again since -- he was back in the camp, playing cards, when someone came in next door, and discharged their weapon. 
As the gun went off, that blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table, like a child. 
He was shaking, panicking. 
He ended up working as a croupier in a Beirut casino where I later found him, because he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job. 
So I thought to myself, "What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars? 
What is this unknown thing?" 
It was too common to be coincidental. 
So I started to investigate -- that's all I know how to do. 
I started to investigate by looking through books, reaching out to psychiatrists, going to museums, libraries, etc. 
Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this -- often military psychiatrists -- and that what we were dealing with was called trauma. 
Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis. 
It was something that existed, but that we never spoke about. 
So, this trauma -- what is it? 
Well, it's an encounter with death. 
I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death -- I'm not talking about dead bodies, or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed, or someone who got hit by a car. 
I'm talking about facing the void of death. 
And that is something no one is supposed to see. 
People used to say, "Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye." 
A human being should not have to face the void of death. 
But when that happens, it can remain invisible for a while -- days, weeks, months, sometimes years. 
And then, at some point, it explodes, because it's something that has entered your brain -- a sort of window between an image and your mind -- that has penetrated your brain, staying there and taking up all the space inside. 
And there are people -- men, women, who suddenly no longer sleep. 
And they experience horrible anxiety attacks -- panic attacks, not just minor fears. 
They suddenly don't want to sleep, because when they do, they have the same nightmare every night. 
They see the same image every night. 
For example, a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him. 
He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel. 
And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed. 
It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything. 
And he says -- later he will say, "I saw death. 
And from then on, he knows he is dead. 
It is not a perception -- he is convinced that he is dead. 
In reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever, and he didn't actually get shot -- but to him, he died in that moment. 
Or it can be the smell of a mass grave -- I saw a lot of that in Rwanda. 
It can be the voice of a friend calling, and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do. 
You hear that voice, and you wake up every night -- for weeks, months -- in a trance-like state, anxious and terrified, like a child. 
I have seen men cry -- just like children -- from seeing the same image. 
So having that image of horror in your brain, seeing the void of death -- that analogue of horror which is hiding something -- will completely take over. 
You cannot do anything, anything at all. 
You cannot work anymore, you cannot love anymore. 
You go home and don't recognize anyone. 
You don't even recognize yourself. 
You hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill. 
I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside, in case someone tried to get in. 
All of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill or hide or run away. 
You want to be loved, but you hate everyone. 
It's a feeling that seizes you entirely day in and day out, and you suffer tremendously. 
And no one understands. 
They say, "There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries. 
You went to war, came back; you're fine." 
These people suffer tremendously. 
After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner -- I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide. 
Some commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking. 
Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor who used to drink, never said a word, always in a bad mood, beat his wife and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying. 
And why do we not talk about this? 
We don't talk about it because it's taboo. 
It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death. 
But others don't want hear it. 
The first time I returned from an assignment, They said, "Oh! He's back." 
There was a fancy dinner -- white tablecloth, candles, guests. 
"Tell us everything!" 
After 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks, the hostess had her nose in the ashtray. 
It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening. 
So I don't talk about it anymore. 
People say outright: "Please, stop." 
Is that a rare occurrence? 
One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq -- well, not "died," let me re-phrase that -- one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq suffer from PTSD. 
In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals. 
In Vietnam, 54,000 people died -- Americans. 
In 1987, the US government identified 102,000 -- twice as many -- 102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide. 
Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam. 
So you see, this relates to everything, not just modern warfare, but also ancient wars -- you can read about it, the evidence is there. 
So why do we not talk about it? 
Why have we not talked about it? 
The problem is that if you don't talk about it, you're heading for disaster. 
The only way to heal -- and the good news here is that this is treatable -- think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. -- it's indeed treatable. 
The only way to heal from this trauma, from this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it. 
People used to say, "Language is the only thing that holds all of us together." 
Without language, we're nothing. 
It's the thing that makes us human. 
In the face of such a horrible image -- a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us -- the only way to cope with it is to put human words to it. 
Because these people feel excluded from humanity. 
No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone. 
They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed. 
Someone said, "Doctor, I don't use the subway anymore because I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes." 
Another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease and spent six months with dermatologists, going from doctor to doctor. 
And then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist. 
During his second session, he told the psychiatrist he had a terrible skin disease from head to toe. 
The psychiatrist asked, "Why are you in this state?" 
And the man said, "Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away." 
So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people. 
In order to heal, we need to talk about it. 
The horror needs to be put into words -- human words, so we can organize it and talk about it again. 
We have to look death in the face. 
And if we can do that, if we can talk about these things, then step by step, by working it out verbally, we can reclaim our place in humanity. 
And it is important. 
Silence kills us. 
So what does this mean? 
It means that after a trauma, without question, we lose our "unbearable lightness of being," that sense of immortality that keeps us here -- meaning, if we're here, we almost feel like we're immortal, which we're not, but if we didn't believe that, we'd say, "What's the point of it all?" 
But trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality. 
They've lost their lightness. 
So this means that if we manage to look death in the face, and actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide, like some of the men or women I know did, such as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo and other people I know, like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer, who gave up field assignments after a trauma. 
Five friends of mine committed suicide, they're the ones who did not survive the trauma. 
So if we can look death in the face, if we, mortal humans, human mortals, understand that we are human and mortal, mortal and human, if we can confront death and identify it once again as the most mysterious place of all mysterious places, since no one has ever seen it -- if we can give it back this meaning, yes, we may die, survive and come back to life, but we'll come back stronger than before. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what's on their bookshelves. 
What do my bookshelves say about me? 
Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago, I made an alarming discovery. 
I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured, cosmopolitan sort of person. 
But my bookshelves told a rather different story. 
Pretty much all the titles on them were by British or North American authors, and there was almost nothing in translation. 
Discovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock. 
And when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame. 
I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than English. 
And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant I would probably never encounter them. 
So, I decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading. 
2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK; it was the year of the London Olympics. 
And so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel, short story collection or memoir from every country in the world. 
And so I did. 
And it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today. 
But it started with some practical problems. 
After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project, I ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations, to which I added Taiwan, which gave me a total of 196 countries. 
And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about, roughly, four books a week around working five days a week, I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able to get books in English from every country. 
Only around 4.5 percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations, and the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world. 
Although, the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher. 
4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with, but what that figure doesn't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to English-language publishers. 
So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French and published in the UK each year, most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland. 
French-speaking Africa, on the other hand, will rarely ever get a look-in. 
The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in English. 
Their books remain invisible to readers of the world's most published language. 
But when it came to reading the world, the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that I didn't know where to start. 
Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books, I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world. 
I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland. 
I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia. 
There was no hiding it -- I was a clueless literary xenophobe. 
So how on earth was I going to read the world? 
I was going to have to ask for help. 
So in October 2011, I registered my blog, ayearofreadingtheworld.com, and I posted a short appeal online. 
I explained who I was, how narrow my reading had been, and I asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what I might read from other parts of the planet. 
Now, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested, but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online, people started to get in touch. 
At first, it was friends and colleagues. 
Then it was friends of friends. 
And pretty soon, it was strangers. 
Four days after I put that appeal online, I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur. 
She said she loved the sound of my project, could she go to her local English-language bookshop and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me? 
I accepted enthusiastically, and a few weeks later, a package arrived containing not one, but two books -- Rafidah's choice from Malaysia, and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me. 
Now, at the time, I was amazed that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away would go to such lengths to help someone she would probably never meet. 
But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year. 
Time and again, people went out of their way to help me. 
Some took on research on my behalf, and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me. 
It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to encounter it with an open mind, the world will help you. 
When it came to countries with little or no commercially available literature in English, people went further still. 
Books often came from surprising sources. 
My Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter. 
Yes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account. 
And when I tweeted at it about my project, it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan. 
I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message, asking if any of his Spanish-language novels had been translated into English. 
And he said that nothing had been published, but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel "The Golden Horse." 
He emailed this to me, allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in English. 
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way. 
From Sweden to Palau, writers and translators sent me self-published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers or that were no longer available, giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds. 
I read, for example, about the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance against the Portuguese in the 19th century; and about marriage rituals in a remote village on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan. 
I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones. 
(Laughter) And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola. 
But perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world, came towards the end of my quest, when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking African island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe. 
Now, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find a book that had been translated into English from the nation, it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch. 
Now, I was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this, and give up their time for something like that. 
But, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook for Portuguese speakers, I had more people than I could involve in the project, including Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field, who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago. 
With my nine volunteers in place, I managed to find a book by a São Toméan author that I could buy enough copies of online. 
Here's one of them. 
And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers. 
They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection, stuck to their word, sent their translations back to me, and within six weeks, I had the entire book to read. 
In that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world, my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity. 
When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe, it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories, but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor. 
My weakness had become the project's strength. 
The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things. 
As those who enjoy reading will know, books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else's mindset, so that, for a while at least, you look at the world through different eyes. 
That can be an uncomfortable experience, particularly if you're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own. 
But it can also be really enlightening. 
Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking. 
And it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world. 
When I looked back at much of the English-language literature I'd grown up with, for example, I began to see how narrow a lot of it was, compared to the richness that the world has to offer. 
And as the pages turned, something else started to happen, too. 
Little by little, that long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed from a rather dry, academic register of place names into living, breathing entities. 
Now, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book. 
But cumulatively, the stories I read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness, diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet. 
It was as though the world's stories and the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me. 
These days, when I look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e-reader, they tell a rather different story. 
It's the story of the power books have to connect us across political, geographical, cultural, social, religious divides. 
It's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together. 
And, it's testament to the extraordinary times we live in, where, thanks to the Internet, it's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story, a worldview, a book with someone she may never meet, on the other side of the planet. 
I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come. 
And I hope many more people will join me. 
If we all read more widely, there'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books, and we would all be richer for that. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

You might think there are many things that I can't do because I cannot see. 
That's largely true. 
Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage. 
But there is also a lot that I can do. 
This is me rock climbing for the first time. 
Actually, I love sports and I can play many sports, like swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on. 
But there is one limitation: somebody needs to help me. 
I want to be independent. 
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident. 
I was an active, independent teenager, and suddenly I became blind. 
The hardest thing for me was losing my independence. 
Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone. 
For example, one of my challenges was textbooks. 
Back then, there were no personal computers, no Internet, no smartphones. 
So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks, and I had to create my own books in Braille. 
Can you imagine? 
Of course, my brothers were not happy about it, and later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them. 
(Laughter) I think they tried to stay away from me. 
I don't blame them. 
I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone. 
That became my strong desire to ignite innovation. 
Jump ahead to the mid-1980s. 
I got to know cutting-edge technologies and I thought to myself, how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille? 
These amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself. 
That's the moment my innovation journey began. 
I started developing digital book technologies, such as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network. 
Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks, by using personal computers and mobile devices, in Braille or in voice. 
This may not surprise you, since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015. 
But Braille went digital many years before digital books, already in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago. 
Strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity to create digital books way back then. 
And this is actually not the first time this happened, because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation. 
The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people. 
Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities. 
Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life. 
In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet and web browsing. 
I remember the first time I went on the web. 
I was astonished. 
I could access newspapers at any time and every day. 
I could even search for any information by myself. 
I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet, and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice, which dramatically simplified the user interface. 
This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in 1997, first in Japanese and later, translated into 11 languages. 
When I developed the Home Page Reader, I got many comments from users. 
One that I strongly remember said, "For me, the Internet is a small window to the world." 
It was a revolutionary moment for the blind. 
The cyber world became accessible, and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses, way beyond what I imagined. 
It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking. 
Today, I am more independent, but it is still not enough. 
For example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance. 
My goal is to come up here independently. 
And not just here. 
My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you. 
OK, now let me show you the latest technologies. 
This is a smartphone app that we are working on. 
(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet to the door, and keep straight. 
EV: Take the two doors to go out. The door is on your right. 
EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy. 
Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick! 
(Laughter) CA: Where are you going? You look so happy. 
Nick: Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted. 
CA: That's great! Congratulations. 
Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know it was me, and that I look happy? 
(Chieko and Nick laugh) Man: Hi. 
(Laughter) CA: Oh ... hi. 
EV: He is not talking to you, but on his phone. 
EV: Potato chips. 
EV: Dark chocolate with almonds. 
EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday; take apple instead of chocolate. 
(Laughter) EV: Approaching. 
EV: You arrived. 
CA: Now ... 
(Applause) Thank you. 
So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself. 
But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching, in which mood -- we are still working on that part. 
And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social. 
So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world. 
We call this cognitive assistance. 
It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers. 
Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities -- in other words, our five senses. 
This technology is only in an early stage, but eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus, enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street. 
It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me. 
It will become my best buddy, and yours. 
So, this really is a great challenge. 
It is a challenge that needs collaboration, which is why we are creating an open community to accelerate research activities. 
Just this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video. 
The frontier is the real world. 
The blind community is exploring this technical frontier and the pathfinder. 
I hope to work with you to explore the new era, and the next time that I'm on this stage, through technology and innovation, I will be able to walk up here all by myself. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

In the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes. 
One day, I was invited to an important event, and I wanted to wear something special and new for it. 
So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear. 
I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day, and I had access to 3D printers. 
So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer, and I loaded the file on the printer. 
It just printed the pieces overnight. 
The next morning, I just took all the pieces, assembled them together in my hotel room, and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now. 
(Applause) So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes. 
For my senior collection at fashion design school, I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home. 
The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing, and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks. 
I always felt most creative when I worked from home. 
I loved experimenting with new materials, and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects. 
I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials, and then bring them home to experiment on. 
As you can probably imagine, my roommates didn't like that at all. 
(Laughter) So I decided to move on to working with big machines, ones that didn't fit in my living room. 
I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies, like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing. 
One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown. 
We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed. 
They were amazing -- like you can see here. 
But I had a few issues with them. 
They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable. 
The models couldn't sit in them, and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms. 
With 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted, but still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio. 
Later that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace, printed using a home printer. 
I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship. 
So I looked at the necklace, and then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home, why not print my clothes from home, too?" 
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell -- I could just design them and print them directly from home. 
I found a small makerspace, where I learned everything I know about 3D printing. 
Right away, they literally gave me the key to the lab, so I could experiment into the night, every night. 
The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with. 
So what is a filament? 
Filament is the material you feed the printer with. 
And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA, which is a hard and scratchy, breakable material. 
The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex, which is a new kind of filament. 
It's strong, yet very flexible. 
And with it, I was able to print the first garment, the red jacket that had the word "Liberté" -- "freedom" in French -- embedded into it. 
I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself. 
And actually, you can easily download this jacket, and easily change the word to something else. 
For example, your name or your sweetheart's name. 
(Laughter) So the printer plates are small, so I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle. 
And I wanted to solve another challenge. 
I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics. 
That's when I found an open-source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love. 
And with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric. 
And it actually even looks a little bit like lace. 
So I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it -- many kinds of versions out of it. 
And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection. 
So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7. 
And this is actually a really slow process, but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago, so 3D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours, or even minutes. 
So you guys, you want to see what it looks like? 
Audience: Yeah! 
(Applause) Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits. 
Almost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home. 
Even her shoes are printed. 
Audience: Wow! 
Audience: Cool! 
(Applause) Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca. 
(To audience) Thank you, guys. 
So I think in the future, materials will evolve, and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today, like cotton or silk. 
Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements. 
Music was once a very physical thing. 
You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs, but now you can just download the music -- digital music -- directly to your phone. 
Fashion is also a very physical thing. 
And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) [Thank You] (Applause) 

Can I get a show of hands -- how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year? 
That's pretty good. 
Well, it turns out that you share that experience with more than three billion people every year. 
And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world, sometimes, things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic. 
I first actually got into this topic when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year. 
And it turns out that, although Ebola spreads through these more range-limited, large-droplet routes, there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin. 
The worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers, it's pretty scary. 
So with H1N1, there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to 17 other people. 
And then there was this other guy with SARS, who managed to go on a three-hour flight and spread the disease to 22 other people. 
That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower. 
When we take a look at this, what we also find is that it's very difficult to pre-screen for these diseases. 
So when someone actually goes on a plane, they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms, and they could, in turn, spread the disease to many other people in the cabin. 
How that actually works is that right now we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue. 
And then also, that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets. 
What happens right now, though, is that we have this mixing airflow pattern. 
So if someone were to actually sneeze, that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even has a chance to go out through the filter. 
So I thought: clearly, this is a pretty serious problem. 
I didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane, so I decided to build a computer instead. 
It actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics, what we're able to do is create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane. 
And so how, essentially, this works is you would start out with these 2D drawings -- these are floating around in technical papers around the Internet. 
I take that and then I put it into this 3D-modeling software, really building that 3D model. 
And then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces, essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it. 
And then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin, throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation. 
So what we get, actually, with the conventional cabin is this: you'll notice the middle person sneezing, and we go "Splat!" -- it goes right into people's faces. 
It's pretty disgusting. 
From the front, you'll notice those two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time. 
And when we take a look at that from the side, you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin. 
The first thing I thought was, "This is no good." 
So I actually conducted more than 32 different simulations and ultimately, I came up with this solution right here. 
This is what I call a -- patent pending -- Global Inlet Director. 
With this, we're able to reduce pathogen transmission by about 55 times, and increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190 percent. 
So how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material into these existing spots that are already in the plane. 
So it's very cost-effective to install and we can do this directly overnight. 
All we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go. 
And the results that we get are absolutely amazing. 
Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns, we can create these walls of air that come down in-between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones. 
So you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again, but this time, we're able to effectively push that down to the filters for elimination. 
And same thing from the side, you'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down. 
So if you take a look again now at the same scenario but with this innovation installed, you'll notice the middle passenger sneezes, and this time, we're pushing that straight down into the outlet before it gets a chance to infect any other people. 
So you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all. 
Take a look at that from the side as well, you see a very efficient system. 
And in short, with this system, we win. 
When we take a look at what this means, what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes, but also if the window-seat passenger sneezes or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes. 
And so with this solution, what does this mean for the world? 
Well, when we take a look at this from the computer simulation into real life, we can see with this 3D model that I built over here, essentially using 3D printing, we can see those same airflow patterns coming down, right to the passengers. 
In the past, the SARS epidemic actually cost the world about 40 billion dollars. 
And in the future, a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars. 
So before, it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months, spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something. 
But now, we're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right away. 
So it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification, flight testing, and going through all of these regulatory approvals processes. 
But it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions. 
And two years ago, even, this project would not have happened, just because the technology then wouldn't have supported it. 
But now with advanced computing and how developed our Internet is, it's really the golden era for innovation. 
And so the question I ask all of you today is: why wait? 
Together, we can build the future today. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

So, I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you. 
Over the past 10 years in the UK, the return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market by a ratio of around three to one. 
There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors, and they start at around 3,900 pounds. 
And they're projected to achieve about 40 percent growth. 
The biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand. 
Now, this is a real proposition, and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment, but my interest in it is quite different. 
I'm an architect and urban designer, and for the past year and a half, I've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them. 
So in the summer, I did my first exhibition on death and architecture in Venice, and it was called "Death in Venice." 
And because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about, the exhibition was designed to be quite playful, so that people would literally engage with it. 
So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death. 
As you wave your hand across the map, the name of the piece of real estate -- the building or the cemetery -- is revealed. 
And those white shapes that you can see, they're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city. 
In fact, the majority are cemeteries. 
We wanted to show that, even though death and burial are things that we might not think about, they're all around us, and they're important parts of our cities. 
So about half a million people die in the UK each year, and of those, around a quarter will want to be buried. 
But the UK, like many Western European countries, is running out of burial space, especially in the major cities. 
And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while, and the main causes are population growth, the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full. 
There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever, and there's also development pressure -- people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops. 
So they came up with a few solutions. 
They were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years. 
Or maybe we can bury people, like, four deep, so that four people can be buried in the same plot, and we can make more efficient use of the land that way, and in that way, hopefully London will still have space to bury people in the near future. 
But, traditionally, cemeteries haven't been taken care of by the local authority. 
In fact, the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation on anyone in the UK to provide burial space. 
Traditionally, it's been done by private and religious organizations, like churches and mosques and synagogues. 
But there's also occasionally been a for-profit group who has wanted to get in on the act. 
And, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost, and it looks like there's serious money to be made. 
So, actually, if you want to go out and start your own cemetery, you kind of can. 
There was this couple in South Wales, and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it, and they wanted to develop the land. 
They had a load of ideas. 
They first thought about making a caravan park, but the council said no. 
And then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no. 
Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery and they calculated that by doing this, they could increase the value of their land from about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds. 
But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries, like, it's kind of ludicrous, right? 
The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading. 
They look like they're expensive, but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot -- like, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years. 
That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries. 
And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council or by a not-for-profit group. 
But anyway, the council granted these people permission, and they're now trying to build their cemetery. 
So just to explain to you kind of how this works: If I want to build something in the UK, like a cemetery for example, then I have to apply for planning permission first. 
So if I want to build a new office building for a client or if I want to extend my home or, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office, I have to do a load of drawings, and I submit them to the council for permission. 
And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings. 
So they'll look at what it looks like. 
But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment? 
And they'll be thinking about things like, is this thing going to cause pollution or is there going to be a lot of traffic that wants to go to this thing that I've built? 
But also good things. 
Is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use? 
And they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and they'll make a decision. 
So that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery. 
But what if I've got a piece of land and I just want to bury a few people, like five or six? 
Well, then -- actually, I don't need permission from anyone! 
There's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial, and the little bit that there is, is about not polluting water courses, like not polluting rivers or groundwater. 
So actually, if you want to go and make your own mini-cemetery, then you can. 
But I mean, like -- really, who does this? Right? 
Well, if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate, then there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it, and you'll bury your family there. 
But the really weird thing is that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you're allowed to start burying people on it. 
And so that means that, technically, this applies to, like, the back garden of your house in the suburbs. 
(Laughter) So what if you wanted to try this yourself at home? 
Well, there's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you. 
So, the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead -- you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio. 
(Laughter) They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is. 
But that's pretty much it for formal requirements. 
Now, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this, but, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it. 
And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make, they also warn that it might cause the value of your house to drop by 20 percent. 
Although, actually, it's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that. 
So what I find fascinating about this is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death. 
In the UK, and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar, only about 30 percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around death, and even for people over 75, only 45 percent of people have ever talked about this. 
And the reasons that people give ... you know, they think that their death is far off or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it. 
And you know, to a certain extent, there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us. 
The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death, for example, and there's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives to this issue. 
But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities, there's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine. 
So we're not thinking about this, but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it -- they're not taking care of it either. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? 
If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy? 
There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich. 
And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. 
(Laughter) And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more. 
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. 
Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them, those pictures are almost impossible to get. 
Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20. 
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative. 
But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? 
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy? 
We did that. 
The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. 
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out. 
Studies like this are exceedingly rare. 
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field. 
But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers, this study has survived. 
About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. 
And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. 
And I'm the fourth director of the study. 
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. 
The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. 
They all finished college during World War II, and then most went off to serve in the war. 
And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. 
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water. 
When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed. 
They were given medical exams. 
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents. 
And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. 
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States. 
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. 
Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that journey in the opposite direction. 
The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues. 
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives. 
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting." 
The Harvard men never ask that question. 
(Laughter) To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. 
We interview them in their living rooms. 
We get their medical records from their doctors. 
We draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children. 
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. 
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, "You know, it's about time." 
(Laughter) So what have we learned? 
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? 
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. 
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period. 
We've learned three big lessons about relationships. 
The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. 
It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. 
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. 
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. 
And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely. 
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. 
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. 
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced. 
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective. 
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. 
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. 
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. 
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. 
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. 
Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. 
But the people who were in unhappy relationships, on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain. 
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. 
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer. 
And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. 
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time. 
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories. 
So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. 
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? 
Well, we're human. 
What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. 
Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. 
It's also lifelong. It never ends. 
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. 
Just like the millennials in that recent survey, many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. 
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community. 
So what about you? 
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60. 
What might leaning in to relationships even look like? 
Well, the possibilities are practically endless. 
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges. 
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. 
More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: "There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. 
There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that." 
The good life is built with good relationships. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. 
I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. 
But I know that it's there. 
And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. 
On our planet, where there's water, there's life. 
So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. 
At this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. 
Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. 
What I do picks up where their job ends. 
I model the possible climates of exoplanets. 
And here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life. 
Take the planet Venus. 
It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky. 
But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. 
The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius. 
That's hot enough to melt lead. 
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. 
It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. 
The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. 
From these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. 
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. 
For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away. 
So that's more than 100 trillion miles. 
Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. 
It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. 
OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly. 
So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life. 
Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f, with the Earth for reference. 
It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth. 
Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit. 
So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life. 
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. 
Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light, and reflects shorter, bluer light. 
That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. 
The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice. 
Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom. 
Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice. 
My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars. 
There's another contradiction -- that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars, and that light, that energy, heats the ice. 
Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere. 
And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. 
I'm an African-American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines, so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature -- (Laughter) (Applause) ... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists. 
My organization, Rising Stargirls, teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color, using theater, writing and visual art. 
That's another contradiction -- science and art don't often go together, but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn, and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions, and use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all, that we are truly not alone in the universe. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Welcome to Bayeku, a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos -- a vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria, communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed; communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered: fishing, marine transportation and trading; communities where fish yields have diminished; communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days, sometimes weeks, on end. 
Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities. 
The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes. 
Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths. 
In some places, the plant is called Babangida. 
When you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups. 
And you think: fear, restraint. 
In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola. 
When you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections and you think: dashed hopes. 
In the southwestern part of Nigeria, the plant is known as Gbe'borun. 
Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to "gossip," or "talebearer." 
When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction. 
And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria, the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma, And when you hear that, you think of death. 
It literally translates to "death to mother and child." 
I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009. 
It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria. 
I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith, a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development. 
And so here I was in the year 2009, actually, at the end of 2009, in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge. 
And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image. 
It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth. 
And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself, "These poor fisherfolk, how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions." 
And then I thought, "There's got to be a better way." 
A win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the weeds being cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed. 
That, I would say, was my spark moment. 
And so I did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed. 
Out of the several, one struck me the most. 
It was the use of the plant for handicrafts. 
And I thought, "What a great idea." 
Personally, I love handicrafts, especially handicrafts that are woven around a story. 
And so I thought, "This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills." 
And I thought to myself, "Three simple steps to a mega solution." 
First step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth. 
That way, you create access. 
Secondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems. 
And thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products. 
The third step was a challenge. 
See, I'm a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts. 
And so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave. 
And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived, called Sabo. 
Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters." 
And the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country. 
So I literally took my dried weeds in hand, there were several more of them, and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes. 
And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya. 
The problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English and neither did I speak Hausa. 
But some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate. 
And that began my journey of learning how to weave and transform these dried water hyacinth stems into long ropes. 
With my long ropes in hand, I was now equipped to make products. 
And that was the beginning of partnerships. 
Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products. 
So with this in hand, I felt confident that I would be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity. 
So taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold. 
So we have pens, we have tableware, we have purses, we have tissue boxes. 
Thereby, helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light. 
Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable, being aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient. 
Changing names, changing livelihoods. 
From Gbe'borun, gossip, to Olusotan, storyteller. 
And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is "killer of mother and child," to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma, "provider of food for mother and child." 
And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis. 
He said, "If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories. 
And if you want to change a culture, change the stories." 
And so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi, to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba, we have changed the story. 
Thank you for listening. 
(Applause) 

How does your smartphone know exactly where you are? 
The answer lies 12,000 miles over your head in an orbiting satellite that keeps time to the beat of an atomic clock powered by quantum mechanics. 
Phew. 
Let's break that down. 
First of all, why is it so important to know what time it is on a satellite when location is what we're concerned about? 
The first thing your phone needs to determine is how far it is from a satellite. 
Each satellite constantly broadcasts radio signals that travel from space to your phone at the speed of light. 
Your phone records the signal arrival time and uses it to calculate the distance to the satellite using the simple formula, distance = c x time, where c is the speed of light and time is how long the signal traveled. 
But there's a problem. 
Light is incredibly fast. 
If we were only able to calculate time to the nearest second, every location on Earth, and far beyond, would seem to be the same distance from the satellite. 
So in order to calculate that distance to within a few dozen feet, we need the best clock ever invented. 
Enter atomic clocks, some of which are so precise that they would not gain or lose a second even if they ran for the next 300 million years. 
Atomic clocks work because of quantum physics. 
All clocks must have a constant frequency. 
In other words, a clock must carry out some repetitive action to mark off equivalent increments of time. 
Just as a grandfather clock relies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum under gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition between two energy levels of an atom. 
This is where quantum physics comes into play. 
Quantum mechanics says that atoms carry energy, but they can't take on just any arbitrary amount. 
Instead, atomic energy is constrained to a precise set of levels. 
We call these quanta. 
As a simple analogy, think about driving a car onto a freeway. 
As you increase your speed, you would normally continuously go from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour. 
Now, if you had a quantum atomic car, you wouldn't accelerate in a linear fashion. 
Instead, you would instantaneously jump, or transition, from one speed to the next. 
For an atom, when a transition occurs from one energy level to another, quantum mechanics says that the energy difference is equal to a characteristic frequency, multiplied by a constant, where the change in energy is equal to a number, called Planck's constant, times the frequency. 
That characteristic frequency is what we need to make our clock. 
GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium atoms as frequency standards. 
In the case of cesium 133, the characteristic clock frequency is 9,192,631,770 Hz. 
That's 9 billion cycles per second. 
That's a really fast clock. 
No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be, every pendulum, wind-up mechanism and quartz crystal resonates at a slightly different frequency. 
However, every cesium 133 atom in the universe oscillates at the same exact frequency. 
So thanks to the atomic clock, we get a time reading accurate to within 1 billionth of a second, and a very precise measurement of the distance from that satellite. 
Let's ignore the fact that you're almost definitely on Earth. 
We now know that you're at a fixed distance from the satellite. 
In other words, you're somewhere on the surface of a sphere centered around the satellite. 
Measure your distance from a second satellite and you get another overlapping sphere. 
Keep doing that, and with just four measurements, and a little correction using Einstein's theory of relativity, you can pinpoint your location to exactly one point in space. 
So that's all it takes: a multibillion-dollar network of satellites, oscillating cesium atoms, quantum mechanics, relativity, a smartphone, and you. 
No problem. 

When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered, to bring it back. 
Sounded simple enough. 
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter. 
I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work. 
Actually, it was exhausting. 
The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important. 
So why is it so hard to pay attention? 
Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed. 
So what's going on here? 
It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man. 
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. 
We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!" 
We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. 
And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating and where you found it." 
We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. 
See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. 
Trigger, behavior, reward. 
Simple, right? 
Well, after a while, our creative brains say, "You know what? 
You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. 
You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?" 
We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better. 
Same process, just a different trigger. 
Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat. 
Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool." 
So we start smoking. 
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident. 
See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. 
Trigger, behavior, reward. 
And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. 
So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. 
Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits. 
Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. 
So back to my breath. 
What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ... 
but added a twist? 
What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience? 
I'll give you an example. 
In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking. 
Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. 
And the majority of them had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times. 
Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. 
In fact, we even told them to smoke. 
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do." 
And what did they notice? 
Well here's an example from one of our smokers. 
She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" 
Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. 
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. 
(Laughter) Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. 
She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. 
She started to become disenchanted with her behavior. 
Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. 
And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie. 
We call this cognitive control. 
We're using cognition to control our behavior. 
Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful. 
Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience. 
We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful. 
We just can't help ourselves. 
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important. 
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. 
We're just less interested in doing it in the first place. 
And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go. 
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking. 
But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones. 
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. 
This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible. 
And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding. 
What does curiosity feel like? 
It feels good. 
And what happens when we get curious? 
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body sensations come and go. 
These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving that we choke on. 
In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. 
We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point. 
Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior. 
But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. 
So it actually works. 
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. 
Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride. 
In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down. 
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors. 
Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory? 
We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. 
So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises. 
So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment. 
It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... 
or step out of it. 
Instead of see text message, compulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times. 
I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar. 
Because I've cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session. 
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behavior. 
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism. 
How dare we be optimistic? 
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture. 
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, "You must become the change you wish to see in the world." 
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior" is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context. 
I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff. 
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs, it is more important to change the laws. 
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this, we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy. 
In order to solve the climate crisis, we have to solve the democracy crisis. 
And we have one. 
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time. 
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at, just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s, looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction, also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?" 
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black, you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter) Many years ago, when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race. 
And the military historians taught me, during that quest, that military conflicts are typically put into three categories: local battles, regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important global, world war -- strategic conflicts. 
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources, a different approach, a different organizational model. 
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories, and most of what we think about are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution, hazardous waste dumps. But there are also regional environmental problems, like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe to the Arctic, and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico. 
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global, or strategic, conflict. 
Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy. 
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources and political will. But the political will has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources. 
Let me show you these slides here. 
I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here, of course, is the North Polar ice cap. 
Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox. 
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory. 
This is what's happened in the last 28 years. 
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record. 
Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers. 
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States, minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona. 
The amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi. 
The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter, but not as permanent ice, as thin ice -- vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years. 
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland. 
Already, around the Arctic Circle -- this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA. 
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California. 
"They were the best of times, they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence in English literature. I want to share briefly a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size. 
They have exactly the same amount of carbon. 
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere, deposited in the ground as coal, oil, natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average. On Venus, it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible, and putting it into the atmosphere. 
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun. 
It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate. 
The global scientific community says: man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere, thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared. 
You all know that. At the last IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say, "How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent." 
The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was "more than 90 percent." 
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun." If that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in. 
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere. 
Here's the stratosphere: cooler. 
CSI: Climate. 
Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress, but here is the key: when given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom. 
What is missing is a sense of urgency. 
If you agree with the factual analysis, but you don't feel the sense of urgency, where does that leave you? 
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this. 
This is the winner. 
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates: two of them were about the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis. 
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero. 
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older tobacco commercials. 
So here's what we're doing. 
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us. 
But it's not just the developed nations. 
The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace. And actually, their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up very dramatically. The total concentrations: by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985. 
If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture, we would still have this crisis. 
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia -- over thirty years. 
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s. 
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can. 
We have the technologies. 
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this: the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions, all has a single, very simple solution. 
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is. 
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral, to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck -- and some things have changed since the 19th century. 
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis. 
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis. 
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries. This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe. 
This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid" to supply all of the electrical power to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents. 
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done. 
We need to do it for our own economy. 
The latest figures show that the old model is not working. There are a lot of great investments that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil, then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets. 
And it is based on an old model. 
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense. 
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there. 
But geothermal, concentrating solar, advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation. 
You've seen this slide before, but there's a change. 
The only two countries that didn't ratify -- and now there's only one. Australia had an election. 
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there. 
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia. 
Lot of other things contributed to it, but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had. 
This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names, we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina, and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta. 
We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture. 
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S. 
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there, just to localize this -- which is good news. 
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine. 
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially, but also the rest of the world, have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through. 
We now have a culture of distraction. 
But we have a planetary emergency. 
And we have to find a way to create, in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission. 
I wish I could find the words to convey this. 
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet. 
Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote. 
We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it. 
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War, we could be well on the way to solving this challenge. 
We have the capacity to do it. 
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge, to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us. 
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible. 
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts? 
A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which, a thousand years from now, philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future. 
Let's do that. Thank you very much. 
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form -- one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true. 
That hurts. 
Al Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter) CA: When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's -- are you excited by their plans on global warming? 
AG: The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain, and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership, and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions -- and, by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label, "Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that? 
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal." 
"Now, even lower emissions!" 
The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed. 
So they're saying the right things and they may -- whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing, but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough there, and then confronted the United States Senate, only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say. 
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization. 
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally. 
And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past. 
So that's why I began by saying, be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen. 
Demand -- change the light bulbs, but change the laws. Change the global treaties. 
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this -- We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that. 
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet. 
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens. 
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources. 
Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe that between now and November, it is possible. 
This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign -- grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads, radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen. 
We need help. We need help. 
CA: In terms of your own personal role going forward, Al, is there something more than that you would like to be doing? 
AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question. What can I do? 
Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do? 
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us, but again, not just with the light bulbs. 
We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy. 
We can change things, but we have to actively change. 
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness. 
And that's hard to -- that's hard to create -- but it is coming. 
There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly. 
So we have to have a change in consciousness. 
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency. 
A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge. 
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED. 
AG: Thank you. Thank you very much. 

All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food? 
(Laughter) And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them? 
(Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health. 
But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- (Laughter) are not safe either. 
So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal. 
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. 
We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other. 
And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. 
Again, that means we're not listening to each other. 
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance. 
Now, part of that is due to technology. 
The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. 
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. 
And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. 
There's this great piece in The Atlantic. 
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. 
And he gave his kids a communication project. 
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. 
And he said this: "I came to realize..." 
(Laughter) "I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. 
Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. 
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?" 
Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. 
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like. 
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. 
But I still have a great conversation with them. 
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. 
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. 
So I want you to forget all of that. 
It is crap. 
(Laughter) There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. 
So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. 
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody. 
We've all had really great conversations. 
We've had them before. We know what it's like. 
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. 
There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that. 
So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations. 
Number one: Don't multitask. 
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. 
I mean, be present. 
Be in that moment. 
Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. 
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. 
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it. 
Number two: Don't pontificate. 
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog. 
(Laughter) Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. 
If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. 
If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. 
Totally predictable. 
And you don't want to be like that. 
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. 
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. 
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. 
He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. 
Again, assume that you have something to learn. 
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't." 
I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something. 
Number three: Use open-ended questions. 
In this case, take a cue from journalists. 
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. 
If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out. 
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" 
you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." 
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." 
Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. 
Try asking them things like, "What was that like?" 
"How did that feel?" 
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response. 
Number four: Go with the flow. 
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. 
We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. 
That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that. 
And we do the exact same thing. 
We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. 
(Laughter) And we stop listening. 
Stories and ideas are going to come to you. 
You need to let them come and let them go. 
Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. 
Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. 
Do that. Err on the side of caution. 
Talk should not be cheap. 
Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs. 
If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. 
If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job. 
It's not the same. It is never the same. 
All experiences are individual. 
And, more importantly, it is not about you. 
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. 
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers." 
(Laughter) Conversations are not a promotional opportunity. 
Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. 
It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. 
Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. 
Don't do that. 
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. 
Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. 
They don't care. What they care about is you. 
They care about what you're like, what you have in common. 
So forget the details. Leave them out. 
Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. 
Listen. 
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. 
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning." 
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job." 
(Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other? 
Number one, we'd rather talk. 
When I'm talking, I'm in control. 
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in. 
I'm the center of attention. 
I can bolster my own identity. 
But there's another reason: We get distracted. 
The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. 
So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. 
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. 
You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place. 
(Laughter) You have to listen to one another. 
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. 
He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. 
We listen with the intent to reply." 
One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief. 
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister] (Laughter) (Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people. 
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home. 
People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was? 
She was the runner-up to Miss America. 
He was the mayor of Sacramento. 
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer." 
And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. 
And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host. 
I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. 
You do the same thing. 
Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. 
I ran for Congress. 
For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. 
The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992. 
She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary. 
But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. 
The polls, however, told a very different story. 
My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. 
But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race. 
I swore I was going to win. 
I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country. 
I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running. 
But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. 
Don't do the math. 
It was humiliating. 
Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk about the importance of failure. 
Nor is it about leaning in. 
I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. 
And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they're going to be great in, that they know they're going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. 
Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure. 
We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. 
Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst. 
And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated to take risk after risk. 
They're rewarded for it. 
It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups. 
In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. 
Some people worry about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. 
Our economy, our society, we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave. 
The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. 
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. 
She found that bright girls were quick to give up. 
The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up. 
Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material to be a challenge. 
They found it energizing. 
They were more likely to redouble their efforts. 
What's going on? 
Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. 
The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge. 
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. 
An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications. 
100 percent. 
This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. 
But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. 
(Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers. 
And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. 
(Applause) So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code, and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. 
Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. 
Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life. 
It requires perseverance. 
It requires imperfection. 
We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. 
Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story. 
During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." 
The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. 
If she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen. 
But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it. 
She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. 
Instead of showing the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. 
Perfection or bust. 
It turns out that our girls are really good at coding, but it's not enough just to teach them to code. 
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students. 
When the guys are struggling with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something wrong with my code." 
The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something wrong with me." 
We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone. 
Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system. 
I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. 
When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. 
Take, for instance, two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. 
Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls. 
Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. 
These are just three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance. 
And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. 
And those dreams have never been more important for our country. 
For the American economy, for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half our population. 
We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. 
We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. 
We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. 
And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. 
It's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision. 
Tell me how it's going. 
How many girls are involved now in your program? 
Reshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. 
This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states. 
(Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science. 
Like, the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly. 
CA: And you're working with some of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming graduates from your program? 
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. 
And if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office. 
CA: And you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams, good things happen. 
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women. 
Women use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men. 
We own the Internet, and we should be building the companies of tomorrow. 
And I think when companies have diverse teams, and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things, and we see it every day. 
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there. You're doing incredibly important work. 
This whole community is cheering you on. More power to you. Thank you. 
RS: Thank you. 

Here are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new. 
To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation. 
Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing. 
Consider Facit. 
I'm actually old enough to remember them. 
Facit was a fantastic company. 
They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world. 
Everybody used them. 
And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along? 
They continued doing exactly the same. 
In six months, they went from maximum revenue ... 
and they were gone. 
Gone. 
To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators. 
(Laughter) Facit did too much exploitation. 
But exploration can go wild, too. 
A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company. 
Let's call them OncoSearch. 
The company was brilliant. 
They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer. 
Every day was about creating something new. 
They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, "When we only get it right," or even, "We want it perfect." 
The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete. 
OncoSearch did too much exploration. 
I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University. 
The founder of the idea is Jim March. 
And to me the power of the idea is its practicality. 
Exploration. 
Exploration is about coming up with what's new. 
It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations. 
It's about changing our frontiers. 
Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc. 
I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be. 
We all know that exploration is risky. 
We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high. 
Exploitation is the opposite. 
Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better. 
Exploitation is about making our trains run on time. 
It's about making good products faster and cheaper. 
Exploitation is not risky -- in the short term. 
But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term. 
And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic. 
That's the risk of exploitation. 
So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore. 
If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit. 
Small children, they explore all day. 
All day it's about exploration. 
As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on. 
The same goes for companies. 
Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent. 
And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs. 
And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways. 
For example, "How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?" 
Or, "How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?" 
So, doing one well is difficult. 
Doing both well as the same time is art -- pushing both exploration and exploitation. 
So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel. 
But when they do, the payoffs are huge. 
So we have lots of great examples. 
We have Nestlé creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability -- there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge. 
Why is balancing so difficult? 
I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are. 
So I'll talk about two, but there are many. 
So let's talk about the perpetual search trap. 
We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work. 
So instead of staying with it, we create something new. 
But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated. 
OncoSearch was a good example. 
A famous example is, of course, Xerox. 
But we don't only see this in companies. 
We see this in the public sector as well. 
We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work. 
But still, we change much more often. 
We really don't give them the chance. 
Another trap is the success trap. 
Facit fell into the success trap. 
They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it. 
They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change. 
We are like that, too. 
When we know something well, it's difficult to change. 
Bill Gates has said: "Success is a lousy teacher. 
It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail." 
That's the challenge with success. 
So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us. 
And they apply to our companies. 
The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis. 
And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future. 
Netflix -- they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always -- and I think they will always -- keep pushing for the next battle. 
I see other companies that say, "I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes." 
Second one: think in multiple time scales. 
I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one. 
Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent. 
So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important. 
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company -- suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent. 
But companies can't choose. 
They need to fund the journey and lead the long term. 
Third: invite talent. 
I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves. 
I think it's a team sport. 
I think we need to allow challenging. 
I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge. 
I think that's also what good parenting is about. 
Last one: be skeptical of success. 
Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration. 
Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, "Remember, you're only human." 
So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff. 
But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious. 
I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful. 
First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot? 
And what can you do to challenge? 
Second question is: When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me? 
Is that something I should do more of? 
In my case, yes. 
So let me leave you with this. 
Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

There are 200 million clinical cases of falciparum malaria in Africa every year, resulting in half a million deaths. 
I would like to talk to you about malaria vaccines. 
The ones that we have made to date are simply not good enough. 
Why? 
We've been working at it for 100 plus years. 
When we started, technology was limited. 
We could see just a tiny fraction of what the parasite really looked like. 
Today, we are awash with technology, advanced imaging and omics platforms -- genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics. 
These tools have given us a clearer view of just how complex the parasite really is. 
However, in spite of this, our approach to vaccine design has remained pretty rudimentary. 
To make a good vaccine, we must go back to basics to understand how our bodies handle this complexity. 
People who are frequently infected with malaria learn to deal with it. 
They get the infection, but they don't get ill. 
The recipe is encoded in antibodies. 
My team went back to our complex parasite, probed it with samples from Africans who had overcome malaria to answer the question: "What does a successful antibody response look like?" 
We found over 200 proteins, many of which are not on the radar for malaria vaccines. 
My research community may be missing out important parts of the parasite. 
Until recently, when one had identified a protein of interest, they tested whether it might be important for a vaccine by conducting a cohort study. 
This typically involved about 300 participants in a village in Africa, whose samples were analyzed to see whether antibodies to the protein would predict who got malaria and who did not. 
In the past 30 years, these studies have tested a small number of proteins in relatively few samples and usually in single locations. 
The results have not been consistent. 
My team essentially collapsed 30 years of this type of research into one exciting experiment, conducted over just three months. 
Innovatively, we assembled 10,000 samples from 15 locations in seven African countries, spanning time, age and the variable intensity of malaria experienced in Africa. 
We used omics intelligence to prioritize our parasite proteins, synthesize them in the lab and in short, recreated the malaria parasite on a chip. 
We did this in Africa, and we're very proud of that. 
(Applause) The chip is a small glass slide, but it gives us incredible power. 
We simultaneously gathered data on over 100 antibody responses. 
What are we looking for? 
The recipe behind a successful antibody response, so that we can predict what might make a good malaria vaccine. 
We're also trying to figure out exactly what antibodies do to the parasite. 
How do they kill it? 
Do they attack from multiple angles? Is there synergy? 
How much antibody do you need? 
Our studies suggest that having a bit of one antibody won't be enough. 
It might take high concentrations of antibodies against multiple parasite proteins. 
We're also learning that antibodies kill the parasite in multiple ways, and studying any one of these in isolation may not adequately reflect reality. 
Just like we can now see the parasite in greater definition, my team and I are focused on understanding how our bodies overcome this complexity. 
We believe that this could provide the breakthroughs that we need to make malaria history through vaccination. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Shoham Arad: OK, how close are we actually to a malaria vaccine? 
Faith Osier: We're just at the beginning of a process to try and understand what we need to put in the vaccine before we actually start making it. 
So, we're not really close to the vaccine, but we're getting there. 
SA: And we're hopeful. 
FO: And we're very hopeful. 
SA: Tell me about SMART, tell me what does it stand for and why is it important to you? 
FO: So SMART stands for South-South Malaria Antigen Research Partnership. 
The South-South is referring to us in Africa, looking sideways to each other in collaboration, in contrast to always looking to America and looking to Europe, when there is quite some strength within Africa. 
So in SMART, apart from the goal that we have, to develop a malaria vaccine, we are also training African scientists, because the burden of disease in Africa is high, and you need people who will continue to push the boundaries in science, in Africa. 
SA: Yes, yes, correct. 
(Applause) OK, one last question. 
Tell me, I know you mentioned this a little bit, but how would things actually change if there were a malaria vaccine? 
FO: We would save half a million lives every year. 
Two hundred million cases. 
It's estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion US dollars a year. 
So this is economics. 
Africa would simply thrive. 
SA: OK. Thank you, Faith. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

I'm turning 44 next month, and I have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year, a year of fulfillment, realization. 
I have that sense, not because of anything particular in store for me, but because I read it would be a good year in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer. 
"He felt his own age, forty-four ..." 
wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night," "... felt as if he were a solid embodiment of bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to be a man, as if he had arrived." 
Yes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me. 
But I also know that he was; for all of us -- you, me, the subject of his book, age more or less in step, proceed from birth along the same great sequence: through the wonders and confinements of childhood; the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence; the empowerments and millstones of adulthood; the recognitions and resignations of old age. 
There are patterns to life, and they are shared. 
As Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen to me as to them." 
We don't simply live these patterns. 
We record them, too. 
We write them down in books, where they become narratives that we can then read and recognize. 
Books tell us who we've been, who we are, who we will be, too. 
So they have for millennia. 
As James Salter wrote, "Life passes into pages if it passes into anything." 
And so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind: if life passed into pages, there were, somewhere, passages written about every age. 
If I could find them, I could assemble them into a narrative. 
I could assemble them into a life, a long life, a hundred-year life, the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass. 
I was then 37 years old, "an age of discretion," wrote William Trevor. 
I was prone to meditating on time and age. 
An illness in the family and later an injury to me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed. 
And besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable, time seeing through what circumstance did not. 
It was all a bit disheartening. 
A list, though, would last. 
To chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting, would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future, whether we made it there or not. 
And when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed, searching pages and pages for ages and ages. 
Here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years. 
"Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations," "sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments." 
I was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative. 
For starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly. 
Christopher Isherwood used the phrase "the yellow leaf" to describe a man at 53, only one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at 36. 
(Laughter) I was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the next, and that people may experience the same age differently. 
But even so, as the list coalesced, so, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror, did the life that I had been living: finding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure of who one is;" emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation into active life;" learning at 40 "... to close softly the doors to rooms [I would] not be coming back to." 
There I was. 
Of course, there we all are. 
Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer whose beautiful visualizations you see here, and who today is 85 -- all those years "... a ripening and an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov -- noted to me that, like art and like color, literature helps us to remember what we've experienced. 
And indeed, when I shared the list with my grandfather, he nodded in recognition. 
He was then 95 and soon to die, which, wrote Roberto Bolaño, "... is the same as never dying." 
And looking back, he said to me that, yes, Proust was right that at 22, we are sure we will not die, just as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right that at 90, we are sure we will. 
It had happened to him, as to them. 
Now the list is done: a hundred years. 
And looking back over it, I know that I am not done. 
I still have my life to live, still have many more pages to pass into. 
And mindful of Mailer, I await 44. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

We have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... 
but how did they think? 
One natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream -- have always been the same. 
Another possibility is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture may have also changed the structural columns of human thought. 
We may all have different opinions about this. 
Actually, it's a long-standing philosophical debate. 
But is this question even amenable to science? 
Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought. 
And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient books of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today we would call schizophrenics. 
And he made this claim based on the fact that the first humans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions and in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived as coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... 
what today we would call hallucinations. 
And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize that they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices. 
And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think about their own thoughts. 
So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development. 
And this theory is quite spectacular, but it has an obvious problem which is that it's built on just a few and very specific examples. 
So the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner. 
And the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious. 
It's not like Plato woke up one day and then he wrote, "Hello, I'm Plato, and as of today, I have a fully introspective consciousness." 
(Laughter) And this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem. 
We need to find the emergence of a concept that's never said. 
The word introspection does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze. 
So our way to solve this is to build the space of words. 
This is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them is indicative of how closely related they are. 
So for instance, you want the words "dog" and "cat" to be very close together, but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm" to be very far away. 
And this has to be true for any two words within the space. 
And there are different ways that we can construct the space of words. 
One is just asking the experts, a bit like we do with dictionaries. 
Another possibility is following the simple assumption that when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, in the same paragraphs, in the same documents, more often than would be expected just by pure chance. 
And this simple hypothesis, this simple method, with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex and high-dimensional space, turns out to be quite effective. 
And just to give you a flavor of how well this works, this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words. 
And you can see first that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods. 
So you get the fruits, the body parts, the computer parts, the scientific terms and so on. 
The algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy. 
So for instance, you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms. 
And then there are very fine things. 
For instance, the word astronomy, which seems a bit bizarre where it is, is actually exactly where it should be, between what it is, an actual science, and between what it describes, the astronomical terms. 
And we could go on and on with this. 
Actually, if you stare at this for a while, and you just build random trajectories, you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry. 
And this is because, in a way, walking in this space is like walking in the mind. 
And the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions, of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection. 
So for instance, words such as "self," "guilt," "reason," "emotion," are very close to "introspection," but other words, such as "red," "football," "candle," "banana," are just very far away. 
And so once we've built the space, the question of the history of introspection, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract and somehow vague, becomes concrete -- becomes amenable to quantitative science. 
All that we have to do is take the books, we digitize them, and we take this stream of words as a trajectory and project them into the space, and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time circling closely to the concept of introspection. 
And with this, we could analyze the history of introspection in the ancient Greek tradition, for which we have the best available written record. 
So what we did is we took all the books -- we just ordered them by time -- for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection, and we just average that. 
And then we ask whether, as time goes on and on, these books get closer, and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. 
And this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition. 
So you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection. 
But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer, and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. 
And one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different, independent tradition. 
So we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern. 
Again, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament. 
And then we get the peak of introspection in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine," about four centuries after Christ. 
And this was very important, because Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection. 
Actually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology. 
So our algorithm, which has the virtue of being quantitative, of being objective, and of course of being extremely fast -- it just runs in a fraction of a second -- can capture some of the most important conclusions of this long tradition of investigation. 
And this is in a way one of the beauties of science, which is that now this idea can be translated and generalized to a whole lot of different domains. 
So in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness. 
To put it more precisely, whether the words we say today can tell us something of where our minds will be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from now. 
And in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate, our respiration, our genes, on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases, we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak, we tweet, we email, we write, can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong with our minds. 
And with Guillermo Cecchi, who has been my brother in this adventure, we took on this task. 
And we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia. 
And so what we did is, we measured speech at day one, and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psychosis. 
But despite our hopes, we got failure after failure. 
There was just not enough information in semantics to predict the future organization of the mind. 
It was good enough to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group, a bit like we had done for the ancient texts, but not to predict the future onset of psychosis. 
But then we realized that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying, but how they were saying it. 
More specifically, it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were, but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood to the other one. 
And so we came up with this measure, which we termed semantic coherence, which essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic, within one semantic category. 
And it turned out to be that for this group of 34 people, the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict, with 100 percent accuracy, who developed psychosis and who will not. 
And this was something that could not be achieved -- not even close -- with all the other existing clinical measures. 
And I remember vividly, while I was working on this, I was sitting at my computer and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo -- Polo had been my first student back in Buenos Aires, and at the time he was living in New York. 
And there was something in this tweets -- I could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly -- but I got this strong hunch, this strong intuition, that something was going wrong. 
So I picked up the phone, and I called Polo, and in fact he was not feeling well. 
And this simple fact, that reading in between the lines, I could sense, through words, his feelings, was a simple, but very effective way to help. 
What I tell you today is that we're getting close to understanding how we can convert this intuition that we all have, that we all share, into an algorithm. 
And in doing so, we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health, based on objective, quantitative and automated analysis of the words we write, of the words we say. 
Gracias. 
(Applause) 

Speaking up is hard to do. 
I understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago, when my wife and I became new parents. 
It was an amazing moment. 
It was exhilarating and elating, but it was also scary and terrifying. 
And it got particularly terrifying when we got home from the hospital, and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding. 
And we wanted to call our pediatrician, but we also didn't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy, neurotic parent. 
So we worried. 
And we waited. 
When we got to the doctor's office the next day, she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated. 
Our son is fine now, and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her. 
But in that moment, I should've spoken up, but I didn't. 
But sometimes we speak up when we shouldn't, and I learned that over 10 years ago when I let my twin brother down. 
My twin brother is a documentary filmmaker, and for one of his first films, he got an offer from a distribution company. 
He was excited, and he was inclined to accept the offer. 
But as a negotiations researcher, I insisted he make a counteroffer, and I helped him craft the perfect one. 
And it was perfect -- it was perfectly insulting. 
The company was so offended, they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing. 
And I've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up: when they can assert themselves, when they can push their interests, when they can express an opinion, when they can make an ambitious ask. 
And the range of stories are varied and diverse, but they also make up a universal tapestry. 
Can I correct my boss when they make a mistake? 
Can I confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes? 
Can I challenge my friend's insensitive joke? 
Can I tell the person I love the most my deepest insecurities? 
And through these experiences, I've come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior. 
Now, sometimes we're too strong; we push ourselves too much. 
That's what happened with my brother. 
Even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior. 
But sometimes we're too weak. 
That's what happened with my wife and I. 
And this range of acceptable behaviors -- when we stay within our range, we're rewarded. 
When we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways. 
We get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized. 
Or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal. 
Now, the first thing we need to know is: What is my range? 
But the key thing is, our range isn't fixed; it's actually pretty dynamic. 
It expands and it narrows based on the context. 
And there's one thing that determines that range more than anything else, and that's your power. 
Your power determines your range. 
What is power? 
Power comes in lots of forms. 
In negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives. 
So my brother had no alternatives; he lacked power. 
The company had lots of alternatives; they had power. 
Sometimes it's being new to a country, like an immigrant, or new to an organization or new to an experience, like my wife and I as new parents. 
Sometimes it's at work, where someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate. 
Sometimes it's in relationships, where one person's more invested than the other person. 
And the key thing is that when we have lots of power, our range is very wide. 
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave. 
But when we lack power, our range narrows. 
We have very little leeway. 
The problem is that when our range narrows, that produces something called the low-power double bind. 
The low-power double bind happens when, if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed, but if we do speak up, we get punished. 
Now, many of you have heard the phrase the "double bind" and connected it with one thing, and that's gender. 
The gender double bind is women who don't speak up go unnoticed, and women who do speak up get punished. 
And the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so. 
But what my research has shown over the last two decades is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind, it's a really a low-power double bind. 
And what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise. 
Oftentimes we see a difference between a man and a woman or men and women, and think, "Biological cause. There's something fundamentally different about the sexes." 
But in study after study, I've found that a better explanation for many sex differences is really power. 
And so it's the low-power double bind. 
And the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range, and we lack power. 
We have a narrow range, and our double bind is very large. 
So we need to find ways to expand our range. 
And over the last couple decades, my colleagues and I have found two things really matter. 
The first: you seem powerful in your own eyes. 
The second: you seem powerful in the eyes of others. 
When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful; I expand my own range. 
When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range. 
So we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior. 
And I'm going to give you a set of tools today. 
Speaking up is risky, but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up. 
The first tool I'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations in an important finding. 
On average, women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table. 
But Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered there's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious. 
That's when they advocate for others. 
When they advocate for others, they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind. 
They become more assertive. 
This is sometimes called "the mama bear effect." 
Like a mama bear defending her cubs, when we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice. 
But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves. 
How do we do that? 
One of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective-taking. 
And perspective-taking is really simple: it's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person. 
It's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range. 
When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me what I really want. 
But here's the problem: perspective-taking is hard to do. 
So let's do a little experiment. 
I want you all to hold your hand just like this: your finger -- put it up. 
And I want you to draw a capital letter E on your forehead as quickly as possible. 
OK, it turns out that we can draw this E in one of two ways, and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking. 
I'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an E on their forehead -- my former student, Erika Hall. 
And you can see over here, that's the correct E. 
I drew the E so it looks like an E to another person. 
That's the perspective-taking E because it looks like an E from someone else's vantage point. 
But this E over here is the self-focused E. 
We often get self-focused. 
And we particularly get self-focused in a crisis. 
I want to tell you about a particular crisis. 
A man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California. 
And he says, "Give me $2,000, or I'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb." 
Now, the bank manager didn't give him the money. 
She took a step back. 
She took his perspective, and she noticed something really important. 
He asked for a specific amount of money. 
So she said, "Why did you ask for $2,000?" 
And he said, "My friend is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately." 
And she said, "Oh! You don't want to rob the bank -- you want to take out a loan." 
(Laughter) "Why don't you come back to my office, and we can have you fill out the paperwork." 
(Laughter) Now, her quick perspective-taking defused a volatile situation. 
So when we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable. 
Here's another way to be assertive but still be likable, and that is to signal flexibility. 
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson, and you want to sell someone a car. 
You're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options. 
Let's say option A: $24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty. 
Or option B: $23,000 and a three-year warranty. 
My research shows that when you give people a choice among options, it lowers their defenses, and they're more likely to accept your offer. 
And this doesn't just work with salespeople; it works with parents. 
When my niece was four, she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything. 
But then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea. 
What if I gave my daughter a choice? 
This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt. 
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant. 
And it worked brilliantly. 
She got dressed quickly and without resistance. 
When I've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: "When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies." 
So we want to get allies on our side. 
How do we do that? 
Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear. 
When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others, but we also earn strong allies. 
Another way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places, is by asking other people for advice. 
When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them, and we're expressing humility. 
And this really works to solve another double bind. 
And that's the self-promotion double bind. 
The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments, no one notices. 
And if we do, we're not likable. 
But if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments, we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable. 
And this is so powerful it even works when you see it coming. 
There have been multiple times in life when I have been forewarned that a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice. 
I want you to notice three things about this: First, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice. 
Two, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits of asking for advice. 
And three, it still worked! 
I took their perspective, I became more invested in their cause, I became more committed to them because they asked for advice. 
Now, another time we feel more confident speaking up is when we have expertise. 
Expertise gives us credibility. 
When we have high power, we already have credibility. 
We only need good evidence. 
When we lack power, we don't have the credibility. 
We need excellent evidence. 
And one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion. 
I want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them, "I want you to describe a passion of yours to me." 
I've had people do this all over the world and I asked them, "What did you notice about the other person when they described their passion?" 
And the answers are always the same. 
"Their eyes lit up and got big." 
"They smiled a big beaming smile." 
"They used their hands all over -- I had to duck because their hands were coming at me." 
"They talk quickly with a little higher pitch." 
(Laughter) "They leaned in as if telling me a secret." 
And then I said to them, "What happened to you as you listened to their passion?" 
They said, "My eyes lit up. 
I smiled. 
I leaned in." 
When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage, in our own eyes, to speak up, but we also get the permission from others to speak up. 
Tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak. 
Both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears. 
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion, the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women. 
I want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother's wedding. 
Here's a picture of us. 
My dad was a psychologist like me, but his real love and his real passion was cinema, like my brother. 
And so he wrote a speech for my brother's wedding about the roles we play in the human comedy. 
And he said, "The lighter your touch, the better you become at improving and enriching your performance. 
Those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow, change and expand the self. 
Play it well, and your days will be mostly joyful." 
What my dad was saying is that we've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world. 
But he was also saying the essence of this talk: those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and evolving. 
So when a scene calls for it, be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker. 
Have excellent evidence and strong allies. 
Be a passionate perspective taker. 
And if you use those tools -- and each and every one of you can use these tools -- you will expand your range of acceptable behavior, and your days will be mostly joyful. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When people find out I write about time management, they assume two things. 
One is that I'm always on time, and I'm not. 
I have four small children, and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness, but sometimes it's just not their fault. 
I was once late to my own speech on time management. 
(Laughter) We all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony. 
The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there. 
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines, generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day. 
And the idea is that we'll shave bits of time off everyday activities, add it up, and we'll have time for the good stuff. 
I question the entire premise of this piece, but I'm always interested in hearing what they've come up with before they call me. 
Some of my favorites: doing errands where you only have to make right-hand turns -- (Laughter) Being extremely judicious in microwave usage: it says three to three-and-a-half minutes on the package, we're totally getting in on the bottom side of that. 
And my personal favorite, which makes sense on some level, is to DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials. 
That way, you save eight minutes every half hour, so in the course of two hours of watching TV, you find 32 minutes to exercise. 
(Laughter) Which is true. 
You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise? 
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right? 
(Laughter) Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time here and there, add it up, we will finally get to everything we want to do. 
But after studying how successful people spend their time and looking at their schedules hour by hour, I think this idea has it completely backward. 
We don't build the lives we want by saving time. 
We build the lives we want, and then time saves itself. 
Here's what I mean. 
I recently did a time diary project looking at 1,001 days in the lives of extremely busy women. 
They had demanding jobs, sometimes their own businesses, kids to care for, maybe parents to care for, community commitments -- busy, busy people. 
I had them keep track of their time for a week so I could add up how much they worked and slept, and I interviewed them about their strategies, for my book. 
One of the women whose time log I studied goes out on a Wednesday night for something. 
She comes home to find that her water heater has broken, and there is now water all over her basement. 
If you've ever had anything like this happen to you, you know it is a hugely damaging, frightening, sopping mess. 
So she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night, next day she's got plumbers coming in, day after that, professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet. 
All this is being recorded on her time log. 
Winds up taking seven hours of her week. 
Seven hours. 
That's like finding an extra hour in the day. 
But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week, "Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?" 
"Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?" 
I'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said, which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?" 
Yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement, she found seven hours. 
And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic. 
We cannot make more time, but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it. 
And so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater. 
To get at this, I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed. 
By busy, I mean she was running a small business with 12 people on the payroll, she had six children in her spare time. 
I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview on how she "had it all" -- that phrase. 
I remember it was a Thursday morning, and she was not available to speak with me. 
Of course, right? 
But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike, because it was a beautiful spring morning, and she wanted to go for a hike. 
So of course this makes me even more intrigued, and when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this. 
She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do, every minute I spend, is my choice." 
And rather than say, "I don't have time to do x, y or z," she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority." 
"I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority." 
If you think about it, that's really more accurate language. 
I could tell you I don't have time to dust my blinds, but that's not true. 
If you offered to pay me $100,000 to dust my blinds, I would get to it pretty quickly. 
(Laughter) Since that is not going to happen, I can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time; it's that I don't want to do it. 
Using this language reminds us that time is a choice. 
And granted, there may be horrible consequences for making different choices, I will give you that. 
But we are smart people, and certainly over the long run, we have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there. 
So how do we do that? 
How do we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater? 
Well, first we need to figure out what they are. 
I want to give you two strategies for thinking about this. 
The first, on the professional side: I'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting annual performance reviews. 
You look back over your successes over the year, your "opportunities for growth." 
And this serves its purpose, but I find it's more effective to do this looking forward. 
So I want you to pretend it's the end of next year. 
You're giving yourself a performance review, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally. 
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing? 
So you can write next year's performance review now. 
And you can do this for your personal life, too. 
I'm sure many of you, like me, come December, get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper, on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter. 
(Laughter) Bit of a wretched genre of literature, really, going on about how amazing everyone in the household is, or even more scintillating, how busy everyone in the household is. 
But these letters serve a purpose, which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year. 
So this year's kind of done, but I want you to pretend it's the end of next year, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and the people you care about. 
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing? 
So you can write next year's family holiday letter now. 
Don't send it. 
(Laughter) Please, don't send it. 
But you can write it. 
And now, between the performance review and the family holiday letter, we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year. 
And now we need to break these down into doable steps. 
So maybe you want to write a family history. 
First, you can read some other family histories, get a sense for the style. 
Then maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives, set up appointments to interview them. 
Or maybe you want to run a 5K. 
So you need to find a race and sign up, figure out a training plan, and dig those shoes out of the back of the closet. 
And then -- this is key -- we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater, by putting them into our schedules first. 
We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them. 
I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons. 
Friday afternoon is what an economist might call a "low opportunity cost" time. 
Most of us are not sitting there on Friday afternoons saying, "I am excited to make progress toward my personal and professional priorities right now." 
(Laughter) But we are willing to think about what those should be. 
So take a little bit of time Friday afternoon, make yourself a three-category priority list: career, relationships, self. 
Making a three-category list reminds us that there should be something in all three categories. 
Career, we think about; relationships, self -- not so much. 
But anyway, just a short list, two to three items in each. 
Then look out over the whole of the next week, and see where you can plan them in. 
Where you plan them in is up to you. 
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others. 
I mean, some people's lives are just harder than others. 
It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own. 
I get that. 
And I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle. 
But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering. 
There are 168 hours in a week. 
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours. 
That is a lot of time. 
If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week, sleeping eight hours a night, so 56 hours a week -- that leaves 72 hours for other things. 
That is a lot of time. 
You say you're working 50 hours a week, maybe a main job and a side hustle. 
Well, that leaves 62 hours for other things. 
You say you're working 60 hours. 
Well, that leaves 52 hours for other things. 
You say you're working more than 60 hours. 
Well, are you sure? 
(Laughter) There was once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks with time diaries. 
They found that people claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks were off by about 25 hours. 
(Laughter) You can guess in which direction, right? 
Anyway, in 168 hours a week, I think we can find time for what matters to you. 
If you want to spend more time with your kids, you want to study more for a test you're taking, you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two, you can. 
And that's even if you're working way more than full-time hours. 
So we have plenty of time, which is great, because guess what? 
We don't even need that much time to do amazing things. 
But when most of us have bits of time, what do we do? 
Pull out the phone, right? 
Start deleting emails. 
Otherwise, we're puttering around the house or watching TV. 
But small moments can have great power. 
You can use your bits of time for bits of joy. 
Maybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work. 
I know when I had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning, I used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read. 
It made the whole experience almost, almost, enjoyable. 
Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying. 
If family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule, maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute. 
It's about looking at the whole of one's time and seeing where the good stuff can go. 
I truly believe this. 
There is time. 
Even if we are busy, we have time for what matters. 
And when we focus on what matters, we can build the lives we want in the time we've got. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

In 2008, something incredible happened: a man was cured of HIV. 
In over 70 million HIV cases, that was a first and, so far, a last. 
We don't yet understand exactly how he was cured. 
We can cure people of various diseases, such as malaria and hepatitis C, so why can't we cure HIV? 
Well, first let's examine how HIV infects people and progresses into AIDS. 
HIV spreads through exchanges of bodily fluids. 
Unprotected sex and contaminated needles are the leading cause of transmission. 
It, fortunately, cannot spread through air, water, or casual contact. 
Individuals of any age, sexual orientation, gender and race can contract HIV. 
Once inside the body, HIV infects cells that are part of the immune system. 
It particularly targets helper T cells, which help defend the body against bacterial and fungal infections. 
HIV is a retrovirus, which means it can write its genetic code into the genome of infected cells, co-opting them into making more copies of itself. 
During the first stage of HIV infection, the virus replicates within helper T cells, destroying many of them in the process. 
During this stage, patients often experience flu-like symptoms, but are typically not yet in mortal danger. 
However, for a period ranging from a few months to several years, during which time the patient may look and feel completely healthy, the virus continues to replicate and destroy T cells. 
When T cell counts drop too low, patients are in serious danger of contracting deadly infections that healthy immune systems can normally handle. 
This stage of HIV infection is known as AIDS. 
The good news is there are drugs that are highly effective at managing levels of HIV and preventing T cell counts from getting low enough for the disease to progress to AIDS. 
With antiretroviral therapy, most HIV-positive people can expect to live long and healthy lives, and are much less likely to infect others. 
However, there are two major catches. 
One is that HIV-positive patients must keep taking their drugs for the rest of their lives. 
Without them, the virus can make a deadly comeback. 
So, how do these drugs work? 
The most commonly prescribed ones prevent the viral genome from being copied and incorporated into a host cell's DNA. 
Other drugs prevent the virus from maturing or assembling, causing HIV to be unable to infect new cells in the body. 
But HIV hides out somewhere our current drugs cannot reach it: inside the DNA of healthy T cells. 
Most T cells die shortly after being infected with HIV. 
But in a tiny percentage, the instructions for building more HIV viruses lies dormant, sometimes for years. 
So even if we could wipe out every HIV virus from an infected person's body, one of those T cells could activate and start spreading the virus again. 
The other major catch is that not everyone in the world has access to the therapies that could save their lives. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for over 70% of HIV patients worldwide, antiretrovirals reached only about one in three HIV-positive patients in 2012. 
There is no easy answer to this problem. 
A mix of political, economic and cultural barriers makes effective prevention and treatment difficult. 
And even in the U.S., HIV still claims more than 10,000 lives per year. 
However, there is ample cause for hope. 
Researchers may be closer than ever to developing a true cure. 
One research approach involves using a drug to activate all cells harboring the HIV genetic information. 
This would both destroy those cells and flush the virus out into the open, where our current drugs are effective. 
Another is looking to use genetic tools to cut the HIV DNA out of cells genomes altogether. 
And while one cure out of 70 million cases may seem like terrible odds, one is immeasurably better than zero. 
We now know that a cure is possible, and that may give us what we need to beat HIV for good. 

Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives? 
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet. 
They provide half the oxygen we breathe. 
They moderate our climate. 
And they provide jobs and medicine and food including 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population. 
People used to think that the oceans were so vast that they wouldn't be affected by human activities. 
Well today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification, or the evil twin of climate change. 
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide that we have emitted to the atmosphere? 
Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that's causing climate change. 
But as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere more is dissolving into the oceans. 
And this is what's changing our ocean chemistry. 
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, it undergoes a number of chemical reactions. 
Now lucky for you, I don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today. 
But I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean, the seawater pH goes down. 
And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity. 
And this whole process is called ocean acidification. 
And it's happening alongside climate change. 
Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades. 
This figure is an important time series in Hawaii, and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere. 
And this is directly as a result of human activities. 
The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean which you can see is increasing at the same rate as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began. 
The line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry. 
As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean, the seawater pH has gone down, which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity. 
Now in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification -- scientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway. 
And we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rate as these main ocean time-series sites around the world. 
So it's happening right at our doorstep. 
Now I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data to monitor a changing ocean. 
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter. 
So as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions -- so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness, but we are collecting some very valuable data. 
So we lower this instrument over the side of the ship, and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom that can tell us information about the surrounding water, such as temperature or dissolved oxygen. 
And then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles. 
So we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep just off our continental shelf, and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface. 
We take the seawater back on the deck, and then we can either analyze them on the ship or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters. 
But why should we care? 
How is ocean acidification going to affect all of us? 
Well, here are the worrying facts. 
There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent since pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities. 
Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions, we're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percent by the end of this century. 
I mean this is within our children's lifetime. 
This rate of acidification is 10 times faster than any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years. 
So our marine life have never, ever experienced such a fast rate of change before. 
So we literally could not know how they're going to cope. 
Now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago, which was much slower than what we're seeing today. 
And this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species. 
So is that what we're headed for? 
Well, maybe. 
Studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well but many are showing a negative response. 
One of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases, the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease. 
Now these ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells, for example crabs or mussels, oysters. 
Another example are corals. 
They also need these carbonate ions in seawater to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs. 
As ocean acidity increases and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease, these species first find it more difficult to make their shells. 
And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve. 
This here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly. 
And it's an important food source in the ocean for many species, from krill to salmon right up to whales. 
The shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater at a pH that we're expecting by the end of this century. 
After only 45 days at this very realistic pH, you can see the shell has almost completely dissolved. 
So ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain -- and right onto our dinner plates. 
I mean who here likes shellfish? Or salmon? 
Or many other fish species whose food source in the ocean could be affected? 
These are cold-water corals. 
And did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters, just off our continental shelf? 
And they support rich biodiversity, including some very important fisheries. 
It's projected that by the end of this century, 70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire ocean will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure. 
The last example I have are these healthy tropical corals. 
They were placed in seawater at a pH we're expecting by the year 2100. 
After six months, the coral has almost completely dissolved. 
Now coral reefs support 25 percent of all marine life in the entire ocean. 
All marine life. 
So you can see: ocean acidification is a global threat. 
I have an eight-month-old baby boy. 
Unless we start now to slow this down, I dread to think what our oceans will look like when he's a grown man. 
We will see acidification. 
We have already put too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
But we can slow this down. 
We can prevent the worst-case scenario. 
The only way of doing that is by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions. 
This is important for both you and I, for industry, for governments. 
We need to work together, slow down global warming slow down ocean acidification and help to maintain a healthy ocean and a healthy planet for our generation and for generations to come. 
(Applause) 

Paying close attention to something: Not that easy, is it? 
It's because our attention is pulled in so many different directions at a time, and it's in fact pretty impressive if you can stay focused. 
Many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on, but it's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out. 
There are two ways you direct your attention. 
First, there's overt attention. 
In overt attention, you move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it. 
Then there's covert attention. 
In covert attention, you pay attention to something, but without moving your eyes. 
Think of driving for a second. 
Your overt attention, your direction of the eyes, are in front, but that's your covert attention which is constantly scanning the surrounding area, where you don't actually look at them. 
I'm a computational neuroscientist, and I work on cognitive brain-machine interfaces, or bringing together the brain and the computer. 
I love brain patterns. 
Brain patterns are important for us because based on them we can build models for the computers, and based on these models computers can recognize how well our brain functions. 
And if it doesn't function well, then these computers themselves can be used as assistive devices for therapies. 
But that also means something, because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies. 
Right? 
In case of attention, the fact that we can shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by thinking -- that makes covert attention an interesting model for computers. 
So I wanted to know what are the brainwave patterns when you look overtly or when you look covertly. 
I set up an experiment for that. 
In this experiment there are two flickering squares, one of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one. 
Depending on which of these flickers you are paying attention to, certain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same rate as that flickering rate. 
So by analyzing your brain signals, we can track where exactly you are watching or you are paying attention to. 
So to see what happens in your brain when you pay overt attention, I asked people to look directly in one of the squares and pay attention to it. 
In this case, not surprisingly, we saw that these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming from the back of their head, which is responsible for the processing of your visual information. 
But I was really interested to see what happens in your brain when you pay covert attention. 
So this time I asked people to look in the middle of the screen and without moving their eyes, to pay attention to either of these squares. 
When we did that, we saw that both of these flickering rates appeared in their brain signals, but interestingly, only one of them, which was paid attention to, had stronger signals, so there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the brain was basically the activation of the frontal area. 
The front part of your brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human. 
The frontal part, it seems that it works as a filter trying to let information come in only from the right flicker that you are paying attention to and trying to inhibit the information coming from the ignored one. 
The filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention, which is missing in some people, for example in people with ADHD. 
So a person with ADHD cannot inhibit these distractors, and that's why they can't focus for a long time on a single task. 
But what if this person could play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer, and then train his own brain to inhibit these distractors? 
Well, ADHD is just one example. 
We can use these cognitive brain-machine interfaces for many other cognitive fields. 
It was just a few years ago that my grandfather had a stroke, and he lost complete ability to speak. 
He could understand everybody, but there was no way to respond, even not writing because he was illiterate. 
So he passed away in silence. 
I remember thinking at that time: What if we could have a computer which could speak for him? 
Now, after years that I am in this field, I can see that this might be possible. 
Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns when people think about images or even letters, like the letter A generates a different brainwave pattern than the letter B, and so on. 
Could a computer one day communicate for people who can't speak? 
What if a computer can help us understand the thoughts of a person in a coma? 
We are not there yet, but pay close attention. 
We will be there soon. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'd like to introduce you to my mom. 
(Laughter) I'm guessing that's not what you expected, and it's not what I expected either, and thank goodness I realized that an Asian man was not my mom before I hugged him, because that would have been so awkward. 
Recognizing people isn't one of my strengths due to a genetic visual impairment that has no correction or cure. 
As a result, I am legally blind, though I prefer "partially sighted" because it's more optimistic. 
(Laughter) And I'm entitled to the label "disabled." 
I hate the word disabled when it's used to describe people. 
It detonates a mindset of less than that utterly disregards capacity, ability, potential, instead prioritizing brokenness and lack. 
The perspective can be overt. 
What can't he do for himself that I'm going to have to do for him? 
She'll probably need some accommodation that no other employee at this business needs. 
Sometimes, the hidden bias is so sweetly conveyed. 
"Wow, Susan, look at everything you've done in your career and your life. 
How did you do all of that and be visually impaired?" 
(Laughter) I fail at being disabled. 
(Laughter) So in the spirit of incentivizing the rampant failure of people all over the world and enticing the so-called normal to just give it a rest already, here are five tips to fail at being disabled. 
Tip one: know your superpowers. 
The best team I ever led in my career was based on superpowers, and we even gave ourselves fancy-pantsy titles like "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen." 
"The Biscuit Butterer." 
(Laughter) "The Voice of Reason." 
Because we relied on our strengths, our best strengths, we achieved tremendous outcomes. 
The trait that prevents me from recognizing my mom allows me to smoothly adapt, to quickly absorb and accurately process an exhausting volume of cues, tease out what's important, determine multiple processes or potentials for any situation that I'm in, and then select the one that makes the most sense, all in a matter of seconds. 
I see what other people do not. 
Some people think that's a superpower, but my real superpowers are ricocheting off of glass walls -- (Laughter) and letting my friends walk around with kale in their teeth. 
(Laughter) It's true. Don't have lunch with me, or dinner. 
Tip two: be supremely skilled, supremely skilled at getting it wrong. 
It is important to be as equally confident in your superpowers as you are in you FUBARs. 
That's "effed up beyond all recognition" for you millennials. 
(Laughter) Here's a good example. 
It is not a great idea to say, "Don't worry, everything in here is too small for me to see" when you accidentally walk into the men's room -- (Laughter) at one of the world's largest sporting arenas -- (Laughter) or anywhere. 
I really wish that one wasn't true. 
I'm serious. It is better to just walk out and let them think you're drunk. 
(Laughter) Tip three: know that everyone is disabled in some way, like when you have a cold and you can't smell and you realize that the milk that you splashed in your coffee was sour only after you've tasted it. 
Very recently, a woman walked up to me frantic. 
She could not find the bakery she was looking for. 
As I motioned in the direction I thought she should go, saying, "There are no stores on this side of the street so your best bet is to cross --" "Oh my goodness," she interrupted. 
"There it is. 
All I needed was another set of eyes." 
(Laughter) I just let her have it. 
I would have said that, you know, being logical and paying attention and staying calm would have done the trick, but who am I? 
Tip four: point out the disability in others. 
This one is best reserved -- very important note -- this one is best reserved for people you know well, because random strangers typically don't appreciate teachable moments. 
A few years ago, my parents and I went to see the Rockettes, Radio City's high-kicking dancers. 
I leaned over to my dad. 
"The two Rockettes on the left aren't kicking in a straight line." 
"Yes, they are." 
"No, they're not." 
"Yes, they are, and how do you know? 
You can't see." 
But I know what a straight line looks like. 
I had snapped a picture during our back and forth and presented him the evidence that proved I was right. 
He looked at the picture. 
I leaned in further. 
"Who's disabled now?" 
Tip five: pursue audacious goals. 
Flip expectation upside down and shove limitation off a cliff to meet its demise. 
There is a college football linebacker who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles while having one hand. 
There is a teacher who successfully transfers knowledge and inspires countless students while living with Down syndrome. 
And for me, on my long list, to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Darjeeling, India on the backseat of a bicycle built for two. 
It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure, and I'm sure I will have the blurry photos to show for it. 
(Laughter) Oh, before we go on, I forgot to introduce you to my mom. 
I need to do that. 
And here she is, as she would appear to me if I were looking through a crowd of people looking for her. 
Or is that an Asian man? 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Here's a question for you: how many different scents do you think you can smell, and maybe even identify with accuracy? 
100? 
300? 
1,000? 
One study estimates that humans can detect up to one trillion different odors. 
A trillion. 
It's hard to imagine, but your nose has the molecular machinery to make it happen. 
Olfactory receptors -- tiny scent detectors -- are packed into your nose, each one patiently waiting to be activated by the odor, or ligand, that it's been assigned to detect. 
It turns out we humans, like all vertebrates, have lots of olfactory receptors. 
In fact, more of our DNA is devoted to genes for different olfactory receptors than for any other type of protein. 
Why is that? 
Could olfactory receptors be doing something else in addition to allowing us to smell? 
In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel uncovered the molecular identity of olfactory receptors -- work which ultimately led to a Nobel Prize. 
At the time, we all assumed that these receptors were only found in the nose. 
However, about a year or so later, a report emerged of an olfactory receptor expressed in a tissue other than the nose. 
And then another such report emerged, and another. 
We now know that these receptors are found all over the body, including in some pretty unexpected places -- in muscle, in kidneys, lungs and blood vessels. 
But what are they doing there? 
Well, we know that olfactory receptors act as sensitive chemical sensors in the nose -- that's how they mediate our sense of smell. 
It turns out they also act as sensitive chemical sensors in many other parts of the body. 
Now, I'm not saying that your liver can detect the aroma of your morning coffee as you walk into the kitchen. 
Rather, after you drink your morning coffee, your liver might use an olfactory receptor to chemically detect the change in concentration of a chemical floating through your bloodstream. 
Many cell types and tissues in the body use chemical sensors, or chemosensors, to keep track of the concentration of hormones, metabolites and other molecules, and some of these chemosensors are olfactory receptors. 
If you are a pancreas or a kidney and you need a specialized chemical sensor that will allow you to keep track of a specific molecule, why reinvent the wheel? 
One of the first examples of an olfactory receptor found outside the nose showed that human sperm express an olfactory receptor, and that sperm with this receptor will seek out the chemical that the receptor responds to -- the receptor's ligand. 
That is, the sperm will swim toward the ligand. 
This has intriguing implications. 
Are sperm aided in finding the egg by sniffing out the area with the highest ligand concentration? 
I like this example because it clearly demonstrates that an olfactory receptor's primary job is to be a chemical sensor, but depending on the context, it can influence how you perceive a smell, or in which direction sperm will swim, and as it turns out, a huge variety of other processes. 
Olfactory receptors have been implicated in muscle cell migration, in helping the lung to sense and respond to inhaled chemicals, and in wound healing. 
Similarly, taste receptors once thought to be found only in the tongue, are now known to be expressed in cells and tissues throughout the body. 
Even more surprisingly, a recent study found that the light receptors in our eyes also play a role in our blood vessels. 
In my lab, we work on trying to understand the roles of olfactory receptors and taste receptors in the context of the kidney. 
The kidney is a central control center for homeostasis. 
And to us, it makes sense that a homeostatic control center would be a logical place to employ chemical sensors. 
We've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors in the kidney, one of which, olfactory receptor 78, is known to be expressed in cells and tissues that are important in the regulation of blood pressure. 
When this receptor is deleted in mice, their blood pressure is low. 
Surprisingly, this receptor was found to respond to chemicals called short-chain fatty acids that are produced by the bacteria that reside in your gut -- your gut microbiota. 
After being produced by your gut microbiota, these chemicals are absorbed into your bloodstream where they can then interact with receptors like olfactory receptor 78, meaning that the changes in metabolism of your gut microbiota may influence your blood pressure. 
Although we've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors in the kidney, we've only just begun to tease out their different functions and to figure out which chemicals each of them responds to. 
Similar investigations lie ahead for many other organs and tissues -- only a small minority of receptors has been studied to date. 
This is exciting stuff. 
It's revolutionizing our understanding of the scope of influence for one of the five senses. 
And it has the potential to change our understanding of some aspects of human physiology. 
It's still early, but I think we've picked up on the scent of something we're following. 
(Laughter) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Loneliness. 
All of us in this room will experience loneliness at some point in our lives. 
Loneliness is not a function of being alone, but rather, a function of how socially connected you are to those around you. 
There could be somebody in this room right now surrounded by a thousand people experiencing loneliness. 
And while loneliness can be attributed to many things, as an architect, I'm going to tell you today how loneliness can be the result of our built environments -- the very homes we choose to live in. 
Let's take a look at this house. 
It's a nice house. 
There's a big yard, picket fence, two-car garage. 
And the home might be in a neighborhood like this. 
And for many people around the globe, this home, this neighborhood -- it's a dream. 
And yet the danger of achieving this dream is a false sense of connection and an increase in social isolation. 
I know, I can hear you now, there's somebody in the room screaming at me inside their head, "That's my house, and that's my neighborhood, and I know everyone on my block!" 
To which I would answer, "Terrific!" 
And I wish there were more people like you, because I'd wager to guess there's more people in the room living in a similar situation that might not know their neighbors. 
They might recognize them and say hello, but under their breath, they're asking their spouse, "What was their name again?" 
so they can ask a question by name to signify they know them. 
Social media also contributes to this false sense of connection. 
This image is probably all too familiar. 
You're standing in the elevator, sitting in a cafe, and you look around, and everyone's on their phone. 
You're not texting or checking Facebook, but everyone else is, and maybe, like me, you've been in a situation where you've made eye contact, smiled and said hello, and have that person yank out their earbuds and say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?" 
I find this incredibly isolating. 
The concept I'd like to share with you today is an antidote to isolation. 
It's not a new concept. 
In fact, it's an age-old way of living, and it still exists in many non-European cultures around the world. 
And about 50 years ago, the Danes decided to make up a new name, and since then, tens of thousands of Danish people have been living in this connected way. 
And it's being pursued more widely around the globe as people are seeking community. 
This concept is cohousing. 
Cohousing is an intentional neighborhood where people know each other and look after one another. 
In cohousing, you have your own home, but you also share significant spaces, both indoors and out. 
Before I show you some pictures of cohousing, I'd like to first introduce you to my friends Sheila and Spencer. 
When I first met Sheila and Spencer, they were just entering their 60s, and Spencer was looking ahead at the end of a long career in elementary education. 
And he really disliked the idea that he might not have children in his life upon retirement. 
They're now my neighbors. 
We live in a cohousing community that I not only designed, but developed and have my architecture practice in. 
This community is very intentional about our social interactions. 
So let me take you on a tour. 
From the outside, we look like any other small apartment building. 
In fact, we look identical to the one next door, except that we're bright yellow. 
Inside, the homes are fairly conventional. 
We all have living rooms and kitchens, bedrooms and baths, and there are nine of these homes around a central courtyard. 
This one's mine, and this one is Spencer and Sheila's. 
The thing that makes this building uniquely cohousing are not the homes, but rather, what happens here -- the social interactions that happen in and around that central courtyard. 
When I look across the courtyard, I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila. 
In fact, every morning, this is what I see, Spencer waving at me furiously as we're making our breakfasts. 
From our homes, we look down into the courtyard, and depending on the time of year, we see this: kids and grownups in various combinations playing and hanging out with each other. 
There's a lot of giggling and chatter. 
There's a lot of hula-hooping. 
And every now and then, "Hey, quit hitting me!" 
or a cry from one of the kids. 
These are the sounds of our daily lives, and the sounds of social connectedness. 
At the bottom of the courtyard, there are a set of double doors, and those lead into the common house. 
I consider the common house the secret sauce of cohousing. 
It's the secret sauce because it's the place where the social interactions and community life begin, and from there, it radiates out through the rest of the community. 
Inside our common house, we have a large dining room to seat all 28 of us and our guests, and we dine together three times a week. 
In support of those meals, we have a large kitchen so that we can take turns cooking for each other in teams of three. 
So that means, with 17 adults, I lead cook once every six weeks. 
Two other times, I show up and help my team with the preparation and cleanup. 
And all those other nights, I just show up. 
I have dinner, talk with my neighbors, and I go home, having been fed a delicious meal by someone who cares about my vegetarian preferences. 
Our nine families have intentionally chosen an alternative way of living. 
Instead of pursuing the American dream, where we might have been isolated in our single-family homes, we instead chose cohousing, so that we can increase our social connections. 
And that's how cohousing starts: with a shared intention to live collaboratively. 
And intention is the single most important characteristic that differentiates cohousing from any other housing model. 
And while intention is difficult to see or even show, I'm an architect, and I can't help but show you more pictures. 
So here are a few examples to illustrate how intention has been expressed in some of the communities I've visited. 
Through the careful selection of furniture, lighting and acoustic materials to support eating together; in the careful visual location and visual access to kids' play areas around and inside the common house; in the consideration of scale and distribution of social gathering nodes in and around the community to support our daily lives, all of these spaces help contribute to and elevate the sense of communitas in each community. 
What was that word? "Communitas." 
Communitas is a fancy social science way of saying "spirit of community." 
And in visiting over 80 different communities, my measure of communitas became: How frequently did residents eat together? 
While it's completely up to each group how frequently they have common meals, I know some that have eaten together every single night for the past 40 years. 
I know others that have an occasional potluck once or twice a month. 
And from my observations, I can tell you, those that eat together more frequently, exhibit higher levels of communitas. 
It turns out, when you eat together, you start planning more activities together. 
When you eat together, you share more things. 
You start to watch each other's kids. 
You lend our your power tools. You borrow each other's cars. 
And despite all this, as my daughter loves to say, everything is not rainbows and unicorns in cohousing, and I'm not best friends with every single person in my community. 
We even have differences and conflicts. 
But living in cohousing, we're intentional about our relationships. 
We're motivated to resolve our differences. 
We follow up, we check in, we speak our personal truths and, when appropriate, we apologize. 
Skeptics will say that cohousing is only interesting or attractive to a very small group of people. 
And I'll agree with that. 
If you look at Western cultures around the globe, those living in cohousing are just a fractional percent. 
But that needs to change, because our very lives depend upon it. 
In 2015, Brigham Young University completed a study that showed a significant increase risk of premature death in those who were living in isolation. 
The US Surgeon General has declared isolation to be a public health epidemic. 
And this epidemic is not restricted to the US alone. 
So when I said earlier that cohousing is an antidote to isolation, what I should have said is that cohousing can save your life. 
If I was a doctor, I would tell you to take two aspirin, and call me in the morning. 
But as an architect, I'm going to suggest that you take a walk with your neighbor, share a meal together, and call me in 20 years. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So, I'm afraid. 
Right now, on this stage, I feel fear. 
In my life, I ain't met many people that will readily admit when they are afraid. 
And I think that's because deep down, they know how easy it spreads. 
See, fear is like a disease. 
When it moves, it moves like wildfire. 
But what happens when, even in the face of that fear, you do what you've got to do? 
That's called courage. 
And just like fear, courage is contagious. 
See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois. 
That's a small city across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri. 
I have lived in and around St. Louis my entire life. 
When Michael Brown, Jr., an ordinary teenager, was gunned down by police in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri -- another suburb, but north of St. Louis -- I remember thinking, he ain't the first, and he won't be the last young kid to lose his life to law enforcement. 
But see, his death was different. 
When Mike was killed, I remember the powers that be trying to use fear as a weapon. 
The police response to a community in mourning was to use force to impose fear: fear of militarized police, imprisonment, fines. 
The media even tried to make us afraid of each other by the way they spun the story. 
And all of these things have worked in the past. 
But like I said, this time it was different. 
Michael Brown's death and the subsequent treatment of the community led to a string of protests in and around Ferguson and St. Louis. 
When I got out to those protests about the fourth or fifth day, it was not out of courage; it was out of guilt. 
See, I'm black. 
I don't know if y'all noticed that. 
(Laughter) But I couldn't sit in St. Louis, minutes away from Ferguson, and not go see. 
So I got off my ass to go check it out. 
When I got out there, I found something surprising. 
I found anger; there was a lot of that. 
But what I found more of was love. 
People with love for themselves. 
Love for their community. 
And it was beautiful -- until the police showed up. 
Then a new emotion was interjected into the conversation: fear. 
Now, I'm not going to lie; when I saw those armored vehicles, and all that gear and all those guns and all those police I was terrified -- personally. 
And when I looked around that crowd, I saw a lot of people that had the same thing going on. 
But I also saw people with something else inside of them. 
That was courage. 
See, those people yelled, and they screamed, and they were not about to back down from the police. 
They were past that point. 
And then I could feel something in me changing, so I yelled and I screamed, and I noticed that everybody around me was doing the same thing. 
And there was nothing like that feeling. 
So I decided I wanted to do something more. 
I went home, I thought: I'm an artist. I make shit. 
So I started making things specific to the protest, things that would be weapons in a spiritual war, things that would give people voice and things that would fortify them for the road ahead. 
I did a project where I took pictures of the hands of protesters and put them up and down the boarded-up buildings and community shops. 
My goal was to raise awareness and to raise the morale. 
And I think, for a minute at least, it did just that. 
Then I thought, I want to uplift the stories of these people I was watching being courageous in the moment. 
And myself and my friend, and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan did just that with our documentary, "Whose Streets?" 
I kind of became a conduit for all of this courage that was given to me. 
And I think that's part of our job as artists. 
I think we should be conveyors of courage in the work that we do. 
And I think that we are the wall between the normal folks and the people that use their power to spread fear and hate, especially in times like these. 
So I'm going to ask you. 
Y'all the movers and the shakers, you know, the thought leaders: What are you gonna do with the gifts that you've been given to break us from the fear the binds us every day? 
Because, see, I'm afraid every day. 
I can't remember a time when I wasn't. 
But once I figured out that fear was not put in me to cripple me, it was there to protect me, and once I figured out how to use that fear, I found my power. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Someday, we may have robots as smart as people, artificial intelligence, AI. 
How could that happen? 
One route is that we'll just keep accumulating better software, like we've been doing for 70 years. 
At past rates of progress, that may take centuries. 
Some say it'll happen a lot faster as we discover grand new powerful theories of intelligence. 
I'm skeptical. 
But a third scenario is what I'm going to talk about today. 
The idea is to port the software from the human brain. 
To do this, we're going to need three technologies to be good enough, and none of them are there yet. 
First, we're going to need lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers. 
Second, we're going to need to scan individual human brains in fine spatial and chemical detail, to see exactly what cells are where, connected to what, of what type. 
And third, we're going to need computer models of how each kind of brain cell works -- taking input signals, changing interval state and sending output signals. 
If we have good enough models of all the kinds of brain cells and a good enough model of the brain, we can put it together to make a good enough model of an entire brain, and that model would have the same input-output behavior as the original. 
So if you talk to it, it might talk back. 
If you ask it to do things, it might do them. 
And if we could do that, everything would change. 
People have been talking about this idea for decades, under the name of "uploads." 
I'm going to call them "ems." 
When they talk about it, they say, "Is this even possible? 
If you made one, would it be conscious? Or is it just an empty machine? 
If you made one of me, is that me or someone else?" 
These are all fascinating questions that I'm going to ignore ... 
(Laughter) because I see a neglected question: What would actually happen? 
I became obsessed with this question. 
I spent four years trying to analyze it, using standard academic tools, to guess what would happen, and I'm here to tell you what I found. 
But be warned -- I'm not offering inspiration, I'm offering analysis. 
I see my job as telling you what's most likely to happen if we did the least to avoid it. 
If you aren't at least a bit disturbed by something I tell you here, you're just not paying attention. 
(Laughter) OK, the first thing I can tell you is that ems spend most of their life in virtual reality. 
This is what you might look like if you were using virtual reality. 
And this is what you might see: sunlight glinting off of water, you might hear gulls flying above, you might even feel the wind on your cheeks or smell seawater, with advanced hardware. 
Now, if you were to spend a lot of time here, you might want a dashboard where you could do things like make a phone call, move to a new virtual world, check your bank account. 
Now, while this is what you would look like in virtual reality, this is what an em would look like in virtual reality. 
It's computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere. 
But still, it could see and experience the same thing. 
But some things are different for ems. 
First, while you'll probably always notice that virtual reality isn't entirely real, to an em, it can feel as real to them as this room feels to you now or as anything ever feels. 
And ems also have some more action possibilities. 
For example, your mind just always runs at the same speed, but an em can add more or less computer hardware to run faster or slower, and therefore, if the world around them seems to be going too fast, they can just speed up their mind, and the world around them would seem to slow down. 
In addition, an em can make a copy of itself at that moment. 
This copy would remember everything the same, and if it starts out with the same speed, looking at the same speed, it might even need to be told, "You are the copy." 
And em could make archive copies, and with enough archives, an em can be immortal -- in principle, though not usually in practice. 
And an em can move its brain, the computer that represents its brain, from one physical location to another. 
Ems can actually move around the world at the speed of light, and by moving to a new location, they can interact more quickly with ems near that new location. 
So far, I've been talking about what ems can do. 
What do ems choose to do? 
To understand that, we'll need to understand three key facts. 
First, ems by definition do what the human they emulate would do in the same situation. 
So their lives and behavior are very human. 
They're mainly different because they're living in a different world. 
Second, ems need real resources to survive. 
You need food and shelter or you'll die. 
Also, ems need computer hardware, energy, cooling, or they can't exist. 
For every subjective minute that an em experiences, someone, usually that em, had to work to pay for it. 
Third, ems are poor. 
(Laughter) The em population can grow quicker than the em economy, so that means wages fall down to em subsistence levels. 
That means ems have to be working most of the time. 
So that means this is what ems usually see: beautiful and luxurious, but desks -- they're working most of the time. 
Now, a subsistence wage scenario, you might think, is exotic and strange, but it's actually the usual case in human history, and it's how pretty much all wild animals have ever lived, so we know what humans do in this situation. 
Humans basically do what it takes to survive, and this is what lets me say so much about the em world. 
When creatures are rich, like you, you have to know a lot about what they want to figure out what they do. 
When creatures are poor, you know that they mostly do what it takes to survive. 
So we've been talking about the em world from the point of view of the ems -- now, let's step back and look at their whole world. 
First, the em world grows much faster than ours, roughly a hundred times faster. 
So the amount of change we would experience in a century or two, they would experience in a year or two. 
And I'm not really willing to project this age much beyond that, because plausibly by then something else will happen, I don't know what. 
Second, the typical emulation runs even faster, roughly a thousand times human speed. 
So for them, they experience thousands of years in this year or two, and for them, the world around them is actually changing more slowly than your world seems to change for you. 
Third, ems are crammed together in a small number of very dense cities. 
This is not only how they see themselves in virtual reality, it's also how they actually are physically crammed together. 
So at em speeds, physical travel feels really painfully slow, so most em cities are self-sufficient, most war is cyber war, and most of the rest of the earth away from the em cities is left to the humans, because the ems really aren't that interested in it. 
Speaking of humans, you were wanting to hear about that. 
Humans must retire, at once, for good. 
They just can't compete. 
Now, humans start out owning all of the capital in this world. 
The economy grows very fast, their wealth grows very fast. 
Humans get rich, collectively. 
As you may know, most humans today don't actually own that much besides their ability to work, so between now and then, they need to acquire sufficient assets, insurance or sharing arrangements, or they may starve. 
I highly recommend avoiding this outcome. 
(Laughter) Now, you might wonder, why would ems let humans exist? 
Why not kill them, take their stuff? 
But notice we have many unproductive retirees around us today, and we don't kill them and take their stuff. 
(Laughter) In part, that's because it would disrupt the institutions we share with them. 
Other groups would wonder who's next, so plausibly, ems may well let humans retire in peace during the age of em. 
You should worry more that the age of em only lasts a year or two and you don't know what happens next. 
Ems are very much like humans, but they are not like the typical human. 
The typical em is a copy of the few hundred most productive humans. 
So in fact, they are as elite, compared to the typical human, as the typical billionaire, Nobel Prize winner, Olympic gold medalist, head of state. 
Ems look on humans perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude, but not so much respect, which is, if you think about it, how you think about your ancestors. 
We know many things about how humans differ in terms of productivity. 
We can just use those to predict features of ems -- for example, they tend to be smart, conscientious, hard-working, married, religious, middle-aged. 
These are features of ems. 
Em world also contains enormous variety. 
Not only does it continue on with most of the kinds of variety that humans do, including variety of industry and profession, they also have many new kinds of variety, and one of the most important is mind speed. 
Ems can plausibly go from human speed up to a million times faster than human speed, and down to a billion times slower than human speed. 
Faster ems tend to have markers of high status. 
They embody more wealth. They win arguments. 
They sit at premium locations. 
Slower ems are mostly retirees, and they are like the ghosts of our literature. 
If you recall, ghosts are all around us -- you can interact with them if you pay the price. 
But they don't know much, they can't influence much, and they're obsessed with the past, so what's the point? 
(Laughter) Ems also have more variety in the structure of their lives. 
This is your life: you start and you end, really simple. 
This is the life of an em, who every day splits off some short-term copies to do short-term tasks and then end. 
We'll talk more about those short term versions in a moment, but they are much more efficient because they don't have to rest for the next day. 
This em is more opportunistic. 
They make more copies of themselves when there's more demand for that. 
They don't know which way the future's going. 
This is an em designer, who conceives of a large system and then breaks recursively into copies who elaborate that, so ems can implement larger, more coherent designs. 
This an emulation plumber who remembers that every day, for the last 20 years, they only ever worked two hours a day, a life of leisure. 
But what really happened is, every day they had a thousand copies, each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job, and only one of them went on to the next day. 
Objectively, they're working well over 99 percent of the time. 
Subjectively, they remember a life of leisure. 
(Laughter) This, again, is you. You start and you end. 
This could be you if at the start of party, you took a drug that meant you would not remember that party ever after that day. 
Toward the end of the party, will you say to yourself, "I'm about to die, this is terrible. 
That person tomorrow isn't me, because they won't remember what I do." 
Or you could say, "I will go on tomorrow. I just won't remember what I did." 
This is an em who splits off a short-term copy to do a short-term task and then end. 
They have the same two attitude possibilities. 
They can say, "I'm a new short-term creature with a short life. I hate this." 
Or "I'm a part of a larger creature who won't remember this part." 
I predict they'll have that second attitude, not because it's philosophically correct, but because it helps them get along. 
Today, if the president says we must invade Iraq, and you say, "Why?" 
and they say, "State secret," you're not sure if you can trust them, but for ems, a copy of the president and a copy of you can go inside a safe, explain all their secret reasons, and then one bit comes out from your copy to yourself, telling you if you were convinced. 
So now you can know there is a good reason. 
You're eager to decide if you love it or hate it. 
But think: your ancestors from thousands of years ago would have loved or hated your world based on the first few things they heard about it, because your world is really just weird. 
So before judging a strange future world, you should really learn a lot about it, maybe read a whole book about it, and then, if you don't like it, work to change it. 
(Applause) 

So, I teach college students about inequality and race in education, and I like to leave my office open to any of my students who might just want to see me to chat. 
And a few semesters ago, one of my more cheerful students, Mahari, actually came to see me and mentioned that he was feeling a bit like an outcast because he's black. 
He had just transferred to NYU from a community college on a merit scholarship, and turns out, only about five percent of students at NYU are black. 
And so I started to remember that I know that feeling of being an outsider in your own community. 
It's partially what drew me to my work. 
At my university, I'm one of the few faculty members of color, and growing up, I experienced my family's social mobility, moving out of apartments into a nice house, but in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood. 
I was 12, and kids would say that were surprised that I didn't smell like curry. 
(Laughter) That's because school is in the morning, and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast. 
(Laughter) Curry is for dinner. 
(Laughter) So when Mahari was leaving, I asked him how he was coping with feeling isolated. 
And he said that despite feeling lonely, he just threw himself at his work, that he built strategies around his grit and his desire to be successful. 
A mentor of mine is actually Dr. Angela Duckworth, the psychologist at UPenn who has defined this stick-to-itiveness of grit as being "the perseverance and passion for long-term goals." 
Angela's book has become a bestseller, and schools across the country, particularly charter schools, have become interested in citing "grit" as a core value. 
But sometimes grit isn't enough, especially in education. 
So when Mahari was leaving my office, I worried that he might need something more specific to combat the challenges that he mentioned to me. 
As a sociologist, I also study achievement, but from a slightly different perspective. 
I research students who have overcome immense obstacles related to their background. 
Students from low-income, often single-parent households, students who have been homeless, incarcerated or perhaps undocumented, or some who have struggled with substance abuse or lived through violent or sexual trauma. 
So let me tell you about two of the grittiest people I've met. 
Tyrique was raised by a single mother, and then after high school, he fell in with the wrong crowd. 
He got arrested for armed robbery. 
But in prison, he started to work hard. 
He took college credit courses, so when he got out, he was able to get a master's, and today he's a manager at a nonprofit. 
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid, from the Lower East Side to Staten Island to the Bronx. 
She was raised primarily by her extended family, because her own mother had a heroin addiction. 
Yet at 15, Vanessa had to drop out of school, and she had a son of her own. 
But eventually, she was able to go to community college, get her associate's, then go to an elite college to finish her bachelor's. 
So some people might hear these stories and say, "Yes, those two definitely have grit. 
They basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps." 
But that's an incomplete picture, because what's more important is that they had factors in their lives that helped to influence their agency, or their specific capacity to actually overcome the obstacles that they were facing and navigate the system given their circumstances. 
So, allow me to elaborate. 
In prison, Tyrique was actually aimless at first, as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island. 
This is until an older detainee took him aside and asked him to help with the youth program. 
And in mentoring youth, he started to see his own mistakes and possibilities in the teens. 
This is what got him interested in taking college-credit courses. 
And when he got out, he got a job with Fortune Society, where many executives are people who have been formerly incarcerated. 
So then he was able to get a master's in social work, and today, he even lectures at Columbia about prison reform. 
And Vanessa ... 
well, after the birth of her son, she happened to find a program called Vocational Foundation that gave her 20 dollars biweekly, a MetroCard and her first experiences with a computer. 
These simple resources are what helped her get her GED, but then she suffered from a very serious kidney failure, which was particularly problematic because she was only born with one kidney. 
She spent 10 years on dialysis waiting for a successful transplant. 
After that, her mentors at community college had kept in touch with her, and so she was able to go, and they put her in an honors program. 
And that's the pathway that allowed her to become accepted to one of the most elite colleges for women in the country, and she received her bachelor's at 36, setting an incredible example for her young son. 
What these stories primarily indicate is that teaching is social and benefits from social scaffolding. 
There were factors pushing these two in one direction, but through tailored mentorship and opportunities, they were able to reflect on their circumstances and resist negative influences. 
They also learned simple skills like developing a network, or asking for help -- things many of us in this room can forget that we have needed from time to time, or can take for granted. 
And when we think of people like this, we should only think of them as exceptional, but not as exceptions. 
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us of the collective responsibility to help students in similar situations. 
When Presidents Bush, Obama and now even Trump, have called education "the civil rights issue of our time," perhaps we should treat it that way. 
If schools were able to think about the agency that their students have and bring to the table when they push them, what students learn can become more relevant to their lives, and then they can tap into those internal reservoirs of grit and character. 
So this here -- My student Mahari got accepted to law school with scholarships, and not to brag, but I did write one of his letters of recommendation. 
(Laughter) And even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement, I've seen him find his voice along the way, which as someone who's grown up a little bit shy and awkward, I know it takes time and support. 
So even though he will rely a lot on his grit to get him through that first-year law school grind, I'll be there as a mentor for him, check in with him from time to time, maybe take him out to get some curry ... 
(Laughter) so that he can keep growing his agency to succeed even more. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

What are you doing on this stage in front of all these people? 
(Laughter) Run! 
(Laughter) Run now. 
That's the voice of my anxiety talking. 
Even when there's absolutely nothing wrong, I sometimes get this overwhelming sense of doom, like danger is lurking just around the corner. 
You see, a few years ago, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression -- two conditions that often go hand in hand. 
Now, there was a time I wouldn't have told anybody, especially not in front of a big audience. 
As a black woman, I've had to develop extraordinary resilience to succeed. 
And like most people in my community, I had the misconception that depression was a sign of weakness, a character flaw. 
But I wasn't weak; I was a high achiever. 
I'd earned a Master's degree in Media Studies and had a string of high-profile jobs in the film and television industries. 
I'd even won two Emmy Awards for my hard work. 
Sure, I was totally spent, I lacked interest in things I used to enjoy, barely ate, struggled with insomnia and felt isolated and depleted. 
But depressed? 
No, not me. 
It took weeks before I could admit it, but the doctor was right: I was depressed. 
Still, I didn't tell anybody about my diagnosis. 
I was too ashamed. 
I didn't think I had the right to be depressed. 
I had a privileged life with a loving family and a successful career. 
And when I thought about the unspeakable horrors that my ancestors had been through in this country so that I could have it better, my shame grew even deeper. 
I was standing on their shoulders. 
How could I let them down? 
I would hold my head up, put a smile on my face and never tell a soul. 
On July 4, 2013, my world came crashing in on me. 
That was the day I got a phone call from my mom telling me that my 22-year-old nephew, Paul, had ended his life, after years of battling depression and anxiety. 
There are no words that can describe the devastation I felt. 
Paul and I were very close, but I had no idea he was in so much pain. 
Neither one of us had ever talked to the other about our struggles. 
The shame and stigma kept us both silent. 
Now, my way of dealing with adversity is to face it head on, so I spent the next two years researching depression and anxiety, and what I found was mind-blowing. 
The World Health Organization reports that depression is the leading cause of sickness and disability in the world. 
While the exact cause of depression isn't clear, research suggests that most mental disorders develop, at least in part, because of a chemical imbalance in the brain, and/or an underlying genetic predisposition. 
So you can't just shake it off. 
For black Americans, stressors like racism and socioeconomic disparities put them at a 20 percent greater risk of developing a mental disorder, yet they seek mental health services at about half the rate of white Americans. 
One reason is the stigma, with 63 percent of black Americans mistaking depression for a weakness. 
Sadly, the suicide rate among black children has doubled in the past 20 years. 
Now, here's the good news: seventy percent of people struggling with depression will improve with therapy, treatment and medication. 
Armed with this information, I made a decision: I wasn't going to be silent anymore. 
With my family's blessing, I would share our story in hopes of sparking a national conversation. 
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said, "Being strong is killing us." 
She's right. 
We have got to retire those tired, old narratives of the strong black woman and the super-masculine black man, who, no matter how many times they get knocked down, just shake it off and soldier on. 
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness. 
Feelings mean we're human. 
And when we deny our humanity, it leaves us feeling empty inside, searching for ways to self-medicate in order to fill the void. 
My drug was high achievement. 
These days, I share my story openly, and I ask others to share theirs, too. 
I believe that's what it takes to help people who may be suffering in silence to know that they are not alone and to know that with help, they can heal. 
Now, I still have my struggles, particularly with the anxiety, but I'm able to manage it through daily mediation, yoga and a relatively healthy diet. 
(Laughter) If I feel like things are starting to spiral, I make an appointment to see my therapist, a dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong, who has a great sense of humor and a familiarity that I find comforting. 
I will always regret that I couldn't be there for my nephew. 
But my sincerest hope is that I can inspire others with the lesson that I've learned. 
Life is beautiful. 
Sometimes it's messy, and it's always unpredictable. 
But it will all be OK when you have your support system to help you through it. 
I hope that if your burden gets too heavy, you'll ask for a hand, too. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

This session is on natural wonders, and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness. 
I want to try to combine them all, because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder. 
Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself, and much more quickly than people had once realized, if you simply stop doing what's causing the problem. 
And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet. 
I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn't have before, and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet, but that happiness is not -- we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions, what Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom," when you get past the names and forms and rituals that divide people, it's really about -- our nature is to be happy; our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy. 
And so happiness is not something you get, health is generally not something that you get, but rather, all of these different practices -- you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn't develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure or unclog your arteries, even though it can do all those things. 
They're powerful tools for transformation, for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy, to be peaceful, to be joyful and to realize that it's not something that you pursue and get, but rather, it's something that you have already, until you disturb it. 
I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda. 
People would say, "What are you, a Hindu?" 
(Laughter) It's about identifying what's causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness and then to allow that natural healing to occur. 
To me, that's the real natural wonder. 
So, within that larger context, we can talk about diet, stress management -- which are really these spiritual practices -- moderate exercise, smoking cessation, support groups and community, which I'll talk more about, and some vitamins and supplements. 
When people think about the diet I recommend, they think it's really strict. 
For reversing disease, that's what it takes. 
But if you're just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices. 
To the degree that you can move in a healthy direction, you're going to live longer, feel better, lose weight, and so on. 
And in our studies, what we've been able to do is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost -- and in many ways, ancient -- interventions can be. 
We first began by looking at heart disease. 
When I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago, it was thought that once you have heart disease, it can only get worse. 
What we found was, instead of getting worse and worse, in many cases, it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people had once realized. 
This is a representative patient who, at the time, was 73, told he needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead. 
We used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing. 
This is one of the main arteries that feeds the heart, and you can see the narrowing here. 
A year later, it's not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction. 
These minor changes in blockages caused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow, and using cardiac positron-emission tomography, or PET, scans -- blue and black is no blood flow, orange and white is maximal -- huge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery. 
Clinically, he couldn't walk across the street without getting severe chest pain. 
Within a month, like most people, he was pain-free, and within a year, climbing more than 100 floors a day on a StairMaster. 
This is not unusual, and it's part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes, because it makes a big difference in their quality of life. 
If you looked at all the arteries in all the patients, they got worse and worse from one year to five years in the comparison group. 
This is the natural history of heart disease. 
But it's really not natural; we found it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people thought. 
It wasn't a function of how old or sick they were, but of how much they changed. 
The oldest patients improved as much as the young ones. 
I got this Christmas card a few years ago from patients in one of our programs. 
The younger brother is 86; the older one is 95. 
They wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. 
The following year they sent this, which I thought was funny. 
(Laughter) You just never know. 
And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients stopped or reversed the progression of their heart disease. 
Now, I thought if we just did good science, that would change medical practice. 
But that was naive. 
It's important, but not enough, because we doctors do what we get paid to do and trained to do what we get paid to do, so if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education. 
Insurance will cover the bypass and angioplasty but won't, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle. 
So we began, through our nonprofit institute, training hospitals around the country, and we found that most people could avoid surgery. 
And not only was it medically effective, it was also cost-effective. 
The insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30,000 dollars a patient, and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project, paying for 1,800 people to go through the program in the sites we train. 
The fortuneteller says, "I give smokers a discount, because there's not as much to tell." 
(Laughter) I like this slide, because it's a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change and what doesn't. 
What doesn't work is fear of dying, and that's what's normally used. 
Everybody who smokes knows it's not good for you. 
Still, 30 percent of Americans smoke, 80 percent in some parts of the world. 
Why do people do it? 
Well, because it helps them get through the day. 
I'll talk more about this, but the real epidemic isn't just heart disease or obesity or smoking, it's loneliness and depression. 
They're always there for me, and nobody else is. 
You're going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?" 
Or they eat when they get depressed or use alcohol to numb the pain or work too hard or watch too much TV. 
There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain, but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem. 
The pain is not the problem, it's the symptom. 
And telling people they're going to die is too scary to think about, or that they'll get emphysema or a heart attack is too scary, and they don't want to think about it, so they don't. 
The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one. 
And the headline is "Impotent," it's not "Emphysema." 
What was the biggest-selling drug of all time, when it was introduced a few years ago? 
Viagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it. 
It's not like you say, "Joe, I'm having erectile dysfunction. How about you?" 
And yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold. 
It's not so much psychological, it's vascular, and nicotine makes your arteries constrict. 
So does cocaine, so does a high-fat diet, so does emotional stress. 
So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired, lethargic, depressed and impotent. 
And that's not much fun. 
But when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood, you think more clearly, have more energy, your heart gets more blood, as I've shown you. 
Your sexual function improves. 
This is a study: a high-fat meal, within one or two hours, blood flow is measurably less. 
And you've all experienced this at Thanksgiving. 
When you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel? 
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. 
Many of you have kids, and you know that's a big change in your lifestyle. 
People are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they're worth it. 
And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better so quickly. 
For many people, those are choices worth making -- not to live longer, but to live better. 
I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic, because it really is a problem. 
Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. 
It's no joke, it's real. 
And just to show you this, this is from the CDC. 
These are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight. 
And if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 -- you get a new category; '98, '99, 2000 and 2001. 
Mississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight. 
Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well -- (Laughter) but it doesn't last, which is the problem. 
(Laughter) Now, there's no mystery in how you lose weight; you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories. 
Now, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food, which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food, or if you restrict entire categories of foods. 
The other way is to change the type of food. 
And fat has nine calories per gram, whereas protein and carbs only have four. 
So when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food. 
So you can eat the same amount of food, but you're getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories. 
And it's the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type. 
I don't like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it, so thought I'd spend a few minutes on it. 
The myth that you hear is, Americans have been told to eat less fat, the percent of calories from fat is down, Americans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn't make you fat. 
It's a half-truth. 
So the percentage is lower, but the actual amount is higher, so the goal is to reduce both. 
Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died, and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs, the "bad carbs." 
And these are things like -- (Laughter) sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. 
And you get a double whammy: you get all these calories that don't fill you up because you've removed the fiber, and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up. 
Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good, but insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat. 
So the goal is not to go to pork rinds, bacon and sausages -- these are not health foods -- but to go from "bad carbs" to "good carbs." 
Fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber. 
The fiber fills you up before you get too many calories and it slows the absorption, so you don't get that rapid rise in blood sugar. 
And you get all the disease-protective substances. 
It's not just what you exclude from your diet, but also what you include that's protective. 
Just as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad; there are good fats. 
These are predominantly what are called omega-3 fatty acids. 
You find them, for example, in fish oil. 
Bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids in processed food and saturated fats, which we find in meat. 
If you remember nothing else from this talk: three grams a day of fish oil can reduce the risk of heart attack and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent. 
They come in one-gram capsules; more than that just gives you extra fat you don't need. 
It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers, like breast, prostate and colon. 
The problem with the Atkins diet is, everyone knows people who've lost weight on it, but you can lose weight on amphetamines and fen-phen; there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren't good for you. 
You want to do it in a way that enhances your health, not one that harms it. 
The problem is, it's based on this half-truth: Americans eat too many simple carbs, so if you eat fewer, you'll lose weight, and even more weight if you eat whole foods and less fat, and you'll enhance your health rather than harming it. 
He says, "I've got good news. 
While your cholesterol level has remained the same, the research findings have changed." 
(Laughter) Now what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet? 
The red is good; at the beginning and a year later. 
This is from a study in a peer-reviewed journal called "Angiology." 
There's more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend, there's less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet. 
So, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn't happy. 
Now one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath, 54 percent had headaches -- this is not a healthy way to eat. 
So you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you, but when they get too close, it's going to be a problem. 
(Laughter) And more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet, of bone disease, kidney disease, and so on. 
And that's how your body excretes waste -- through your breath, bowels and perspiration. 
So when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad. 
An optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs, high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. 
And then, again, it's a spectrum: when you move in this direction, you're going to lose weight, you'll feel better, and you'll gain health. 
There are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too, whether it's the deforestation in the Amazon or making more protein available to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day, not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have. 
So there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. 
Now, we're about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer, in collaboration with Sloan Kettering and UCSF. 
We took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer, who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery. 
We could randomly divide them into two groups, and then we could have one group that is a nonintervention control group to compare to, which you can't do with, say, breast cancer, because everyone gets treated. 
We found that after a year, none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment, while six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation. 
When we looked at their PSA levels, which is a marker for prostate cancer, they got worse in the control group but got better in the experimental group. 
And the differences were highly significant. 
I wondered -- was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle, whichever group they were in, and the changes in PSA? 
And sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship, just like we did in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies. 
And in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make big changes. 
I then wondered if they're just changing their PSA, but it's not really affecting the tumor growth. 
They added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture, and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent. 
Finally, I wondered if there's any relationship between how much people changed and how much it inhibited their tumor growth, whichever group they were in. 
And this really got me excited because again, we found the same pattern: the more people change, the more it affected the growth of their tumors. 
Finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients. 
The tumor activity is shown in red in this patient, and you can see clearly it's better a year later, along with the PSA going down. 
If it's true for prostate cancer, it'll almost certainly be true for breast cancer. 
And whether or not you have conventional treatment, in addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence. 
The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness, is that study after study has shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely, in part because, as we talked about, they're more likely to smoke, overeat, drink too much, work too hard, and so on. 
But also, through mechanisms that we don't fully understand, people who are lonely and depressed are many times -- three to five to ten times in some studies -- more likely to get sick and die prematurely. 
And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that. 
Now on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing. 
It can be sexual intimacy -- I happen to think healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. 
Friendship, altruism, compassion, service -- all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures, once you stop trying to see the differences -- these are the things that are in our own self-interest, because they free us from our suffering and our disease. 
And it's, in a sense, the most selfish thing that we can do. 
Just to look at one study, done by David Spiegel at Stanford. 
He took women with metastatic breast cancer, randomly divided them into two groups. 
One group met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group. 
It was a nurturing, loving environment, where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood because they were going through it too. 
They met once a week for a year. 
And that was the only difference between the groups. 
It was a randomized control study published in "The Lancet." 
Other studies have shown this as well. 
So these simple things that create intimacy are really healing. 
Even the word "healing" comes from the root "to make whole." 
The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit, meaning "union," "to yoke, to bring together." 
The last slide I want to show you is from -- again, this swami that I studied with for so many years. 
I did a combined oncology and cardiology grand rounds at the University of Virginia medical school a couple years ago. 
And at the end of it, somebody said, "Hey, Swami, what's the difference between wellness and illness?" 
So he went up on the board and wrote the word "illness" and circled the first letter, then wrote the word "wellness," and circled the first two letters. 
To me, it's just shorthand for what we're talking about: that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing. 
Thank you. 

I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. 
And some of you may argue, "Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?" 
But I would say no. 
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?" 
Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. 
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. 
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior. 
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process. 
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time. 
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror. 
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device. 
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry, who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system. 
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. 
The system tracks the four significant fingers. 
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize. 
But if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colors. 
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc. 
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture, and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you. 
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc., again using all natural gestures. 
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?" 
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, etc. 
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk up to any surface, including your hand, if nothing else is available, and interact with this projected data. 
The device is completely portable, and can be -- (Applause) (Applause ends) So, one important difference is that it's totally mobile. 
Another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. 
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report," the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. 
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels. 
And, as he picks up a product, the system can recognize the product that he's picking up, using either image recognition or marker technology, and give him the green light or an orange light. 
He can ask for additional information. 
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria. 
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. 
(Laughter) If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book. 
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon. 
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc. 
If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page. 
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated. 
(Laughter) You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about. 
You can get the latest sports scores, etc. 
This is a more controversial one. 
(Laughter) As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. 
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc. 
On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etc. 
And, if you need to know what the current time is, it's as simple as drawing a watch -- (Laughter) (Applause) on your arm. 
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across. 
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this. 
(Applause and cheering) (Applause ends) He does deserve a lot of applause, because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually. 
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either. 
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress. 
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. 
However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. 
And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger. 
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. 
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. 
When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. 
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. 
I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. 
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. 
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. 
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. 
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx. 
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. 
We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. 
And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. 
(Applause) That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. 
Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. 
Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. 
As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. 
I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. 
These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. 
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? 
Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. 
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. 
Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. 
These impacts are coming everyone's way. 
And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. 
Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. 
Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. 
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. 
Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy. 
Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. 
None of us want that, and we all have that in common. 
So what else do we have in common? 
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking. 
(Laughter) Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. 
OK. Good. 
(Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. 
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. 
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. 
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. 
These things make me different from you. 
But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. 
In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. 
At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. 
My dad was not alone. 
And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. 
Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. 
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. 
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. 
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. 
In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. 
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. 
The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. 
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 
600,000 people were displaced. 
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. 
And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? 
So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. 
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough. 
Now, why is this story important? 
Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. 
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. 
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. 
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? 
What costs are associated with these decisions? 
And who pays? Who profits? 
This was "planning" -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind. 
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. 
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. 
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. 
They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. 
Think bike shops, juice stands. 
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. 
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. 
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that. 
As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. 
We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. 
Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. 
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. 
Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. 
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. 
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development. 
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. 
Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. 
Green roofs are soil and living plants. 
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. 
Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. 
And they provide habitats for our little friends! 
[Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool! 
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx. 
[Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too. 
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. 
It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. 
Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. 
Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. 
Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. 
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. 
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. 
We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. 
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. 
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. 
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. 
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? 
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine? 
Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. 
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. 
Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. 
But I'll tell you later, if you want to know. 
(Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. 
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce. 
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up. 
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. 
A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. 
And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. 
Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. 
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. 
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. 
Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. 
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. 
Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. 
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. 
And I've embraced my inner capitalist. 
And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to. 
(Laughter) So I don't have a problem with developers making money. 
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. 
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that. 
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. 
That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. 
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. 
This is my version of globalization. 
Let's take Bogota. 
Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. 
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa. 
He looked at the demographics. 
Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. 
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. 
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. 
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. 
People stopped littering. 
Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. 
His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. 
We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. 
But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. 
That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. 
But Bogota's example has the power to change that. 
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. 
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. 
Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. 
Don't just talk about it at TED. 
This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. 
Help me make green the new black. 
Help me make sustainability sexy. 
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. 
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. 
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. 
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. 
Oh good, glad I have a little more time! 
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. 
His response was a grant program. 
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. 
(Applause) What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. 
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money. 
(Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. 
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count. 
(Applause) I have come from so far to meet you like this. 
Please don't waste me. 
By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. 
We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. 
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. 
Ciao, bellos! 

Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. 
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. 
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. 
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject. 
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus. 
And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... 
that the correct summit -- that all of our students, every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics: probability and statistics. 
(Applause) I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject. 
It's one of the great products of the human mind. 
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus. 
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. 
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives. 
On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis. Right? 
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness. 
It's understanding data. 
I think if our students, if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics, we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause) Not only -- thank you -- not only that ... 
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun. 
I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling. 
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. 
Look, the world has changed from analog to digital. 
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics. 
In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. 
The truth of the matter is otherwise. 
Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters, and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala, the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful," or, as Sir Richard Burton -- not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor, but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature -- translates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate." 
And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity, God says to his prophet Muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets, beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham, including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad -- that, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad, except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity." 
For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims, whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. 
And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said, "Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God." 
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion -- in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion," or, "reigned himself in by compassion" -- therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion, activators of compassion, actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. 
That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world? 
For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path. 
In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path, or the exoteric path and the esoteric path. 
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic. 
And these doctors or these masters, these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition, refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies. 
In one of the battles that the prophet waged, he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war, to the greater battle." 
And they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary. 
How can we go to a greater battle?" 
He said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego." 
The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I." 
The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend, and he knocks on the door, and a voice answers, "Who's there?" 
"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I," as we might say in English. 
The voice says, "Go away." 
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle, he comes back. 
With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door. 
The voice asks, "Who is there?" 
He said, "It is you, O heartbreaker." 
The door swings open, and the voice says, "Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's," -- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos." 
And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path. 
In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I," and that is the "I" of divinity. 
In a teaching -- called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition -- God says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature, does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do." 
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean. 
You want your employees to do what you ask them to do, and if they've done that, then they can do extra. 
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do. 
"And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me, by doing more of what I've asked them to do" -- extra credit, we might call it -- "until I love him or love her. 
And when I love my servant," God says, "I become the eyes by which he or she sees, the ears by which he or she listens, the hand by which he or she grasps, and the foot by which he or she walks, and the heart by which he or she understands." 
It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. 
Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism, the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path. 
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way," and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God," it is because they became so much an instrument of God, they became part of God's team -- so that God's will was manifest through them, and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos. 
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us. 
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way, get our egotism out of the way. 
I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you, have had what you might call a spiritual experience, a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps, the boundaries of your ego dissolved. 
And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe -- one with that jug of water, one with every human being, one with the Creator -- and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe, of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives. 
That is a moment which is a gift of God to us -- a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me," and instead, like the person in Rumi's story, we say, "Oh, this is all you. 
This is all you. And this is all us. 
And us, and I, and us are all part of you. 
O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being and the end of our journey, you are also the breaker of our hearts. 
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live, and for whose purpose we shall die, and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings." 
Our message today, and our purpose today, and those of you who are here today, and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind. 
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being. 
We know it all. 
We have access to it all. 
Jung may have called it "the subconscious." 
Through our subconscious, in your dreams -- the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death," "the temporary death" -- in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions, we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us, and we see wonderful things. 
We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it, and beyond the limitations of time as we know it. 
But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate. 
God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om, whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity, it is the locus of absolute being, absolute love and mercy and compassion, and absolute knowledge and wisdom, what Hindus call "satchidananda." 
The language differs, but the objective is the same. 
Rumi has another story about three men, a Turk, an Arab and -- and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay. 
One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman -- one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes. 
And they have a fight and an argument because -- "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." -- not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages. 
There's only one absolute reality by definition, one absolute being by definition, because absolute is, by definition, single, and absolute and singular. 
There's this absolute concentration of being, the absolute concentration of consciousness, awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity. 
And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human. 
For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically, is our physiology, but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature. 
And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says, "When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay, and breathed into him of my spirit, then, fall in prostration to him." 
The angels prostrate, not before the human body, but before the human soul. 
Why? Because the soul, the human soul, embodies a piece of the divine breath, a piece of the divine soul. 
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image. 
What is the imagery of God? 
The imagery of God is absolute being, absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love. 
And therefore, for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human, in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us, and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being, of being alive, of beingness; the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness; and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings. 
This is what I understand from my faith tradition, and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions, and this is the common platform on which we must all stand, and when we stand on this platform as such, I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world. 
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge and that, with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah. 
For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore. 
We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option: we must, we must lower our egos, control our egos -- whether it is individual ego, personal ego, family ego, national ego -- and let all be for the glorification of the one. 
Thank you, and God bless you. 
(Applause) 

You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. 
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago. 
And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives. 
We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. 
We go through initiation rites. 
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art. 
But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture. 
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo, or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya, the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes, or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma, Everest, the goddess mother of the world. 
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth. 
And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope. 
Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. 
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere, and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. 
The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. 
It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species. 
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded, so too is the ethnosphere -- and, if anything, at a far greater rate. 
No biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. 
And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss. 
When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet. 
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. 
A language is a flash of the human spirit. 
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. 
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. 
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children. 
They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead. 
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children? 
And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue. 
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great, let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese. 
Let's make it Kogi." 
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language. 
And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. 
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being. 
Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes. 
Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend. 
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "linguistic exogamy:" you must marry someone who speaks a different language. 
And this is all rooted in the mythological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language. 
They simply listen and then begin to speak. 
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador, an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958. 
In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. 
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives. 
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death. 
But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders. 
They speared each other. 
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other. 
We traced genealogies back eight generations, and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. 
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind. 
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies. 
In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult. 
On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview. 
It's interesting. 
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say? 
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever. 
There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era. 
But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. 
So, the living give birth to the spirits. 
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god. 
That's why the Voodooists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God. 
We dance in the temple and become God." 
And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed? 
So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation. 
Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. 
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia, in the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain. 
In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish. 
To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary. 
The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years: two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother. 
And for this entire time, they are inculturated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance. 
And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you. 
It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect." 
They call themselves the "elder brothers" and they say we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world. 
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important. 
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the "noble savage," which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. 
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. 
There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. 
Now, what does that mean? 
It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. 
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant. 
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. 
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut. 
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation. 
Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. 
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April. 
This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire. 
What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis. 
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine. 
If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine. 
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter) It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality. 
In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. 
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. 
Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question. 
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts? 
Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error," which is exposed to be meaningless. 
But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us." 
Well, what does that mean? 
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye as one species. 
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants. 
I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No." 
Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key. 
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter) Now -- (Applause) -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on. 
Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change. 
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life. 
And the problem is not technology itself. 
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy. 
It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power, the crude face of domination. 
Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold. 
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. 
You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned, it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy. 
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level. 
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution. 
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama. 
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion. 
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal. 
His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy. 
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him. 
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp. 
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor. 
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold. 
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity? 
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities. 
And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [150,000] years. 
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago. 
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old. 
Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. 
When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices. 
And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism. 
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people, and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather. 
The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements. 
This old man's grandfather refused to go. 
The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools. 
Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold; they took advantage of it. 
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide. 
So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing. 
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade. 
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it. 
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt. 
Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter) And this, in many ways -- (Applause) -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world. 
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. 
It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut. 
It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources. 
An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people. 
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all. 
They're homelands of somebody. 
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope. 
So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything. 
We think that polemics -- (Applause) -- we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month. 
156 nations carry our television channel. 
Our magazines are read by millions. 
And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. 
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. 
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family. 
And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question. 
She said, "What leads to success?" 
And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer. 
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. 
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people! 
So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids? 
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. 
And the first thing is passion. 
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion." 
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money. 
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do." 
And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway. 
Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work. 
Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun." 
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes! 
(Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. 
I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics. 
(Laughter) Good! 
(Applause) Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it." 
There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice. 
And it's focus. 
Norman Jewison said to me, "I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing." 
And push! 
David Gallo says, "Push yourself. 
Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push." 
You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt. 
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts. 
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. 
I didn't think I'd make it." 
Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Frank Gehry said to me, "My mother pushed me." 
(Laughter) Serve! 
Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor." 
A lot of kids want to be millionaires. 
The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. 
Because that's the way people really get rich." 
Ideas! 
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company." 
I'd say it was a pretty good idea. 
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things. 
And I give lots of evidence. 
Persist! 
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success." 
You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap! 
Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure." 
(Laughter) So, the answer to this question is simple: Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED. 
(Laughter) Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success. 
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews! 
(Applause) 

I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation, the third-largest organized crime, a $10 billion industry. 
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery. 
I'd like to tell you the story of these three children, Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali. 
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution, a prostituted person. 
She got infected with HIV, and towards the end of her life, when she was in the final stages of AIDS, she could not prostitute, so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker. 
By the time we got the information, we reached there, Pranitha was already raped by three men. 
Shaheen's background I don't even know. 
We found her in a railway track, raped by many, many men, I don't know many. 
But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body. 
And when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body. 
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is. 
All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally. 
Anjali's father, a drunkard, sold his child for pornography. 
You're seeing here images of three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. 
In this country, and across the globe, hundreds and thousands of children, as young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery. 
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for. 
They are sold in the name of adoption. 
They are sold in the name of organ trade. 
They are sold in the name of forced labor, camel jockeying, anything, everything. 
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. 
And I tell you stories from there. 
My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager. 
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men. 
I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it. 
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me, but that didn't go into my consciousness. 
I never felt like a victim, then or now. 
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today -- is this huge outrageous anger. 
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated, because I was a victim. 
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. 
We, as a society, we have PhDs in victimizing a victim. 
Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices, but have absolutely no respite, because we don't allow them to come in. 
Where does their journey begin? 
Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor. 
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked. 
I had this I.S. officer's daughter, who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard, who was raped chatting with one individual, and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine, who was trafficked. 
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families, and children from well-to-do families, who are getting trafficked. 
These people are deceived, forced. 
99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution. 
Some pay the price for it. 
They're killed; we don't even hear about them. 
They are voiceless, [unclear], nameless people. 
But the rest, who succumb into it, go through everyday torture. 
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends, or who want to have a family with you. 
These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day, and use you, throw you. 
Each of the girls that I have rescued -- I have rescued more than 3,200 girls -- each of them tell me one story in common ... 
(Applause) one story about one man, at least, putting chili powder in her vagina, one man taking a cigarette and burning her, one man whipping her. 
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us. 
And we are silent about them. 
We think it is easy money. 
We think it is shortcut. 
We think the person likes to do what she's doing. 
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun. 
And one day she gives up on you and me, because we have no options for her. 
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation. 
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about." 
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day. 
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter. 
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated. 
It's in that context that I work. 
It's in that context that I rescue children. 
I've rescued children as young as three years, and I've rescued women as old as 40 years. 
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin. 
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected. 
One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive. 
And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain. 
And for me, I was my greatest experience. 
Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher. 
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential. 
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. 
She works for a very big company, a workshop in Hyderabad, making furnitures. 
She earns around 12,000 rupees. 
She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder. 
Why welding and why not computers? 
We felt, one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage. 
They did not have any pardas inside their body, hijabs inside themselves; they've crossed the barrier of it. 
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world, very easily, and not feel very shy about it. 
We have trained girls as carpenters, as masons, as security guards, as cab drivers. 
And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field, gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives. 
These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons. 
What has been my challenge? 
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up. 
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life. 
I can't hear from my right ear. 
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. 
My biggest challenge is society. 
It's you and me. 
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own. 
A very supportive friend of mine, a well-wisher of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables. 
When her mother fell sick she said, "Sunitha, you have so much of contacts. 
Can you get somebody in my house to work, so that she can look after my mother?" 
And there is a long pause. 
And then she says, "Not one of our girls." 
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking, in this fantastic A-C hall. 
It's very nice for discussion, discourse, making films and everything. 
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes. 
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies. 
It's not nice for our children to study with their children. 
There it ends. 
That's my biggest challenge. 
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan. 
I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking. 
They need your compassion. 
They need your empathy. 
They need, much more than anything else, your acceptance. 
Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing: don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem. 
Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem? 
And that's what I'm here for, asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support. 
Can you break your culture of silence? 
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story? 
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons. 
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars, or something like that. 
I'm asking you, in your limited world, can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts? 
Can you just encompass these people too? 
Because they are also a part of us. 
They are also part of this world. 
I'm asking you, for these children, whose faces you see, they're no more. 
They died of AIDS last year. 
I'm asking you to help them, accept as human beings -- not as philanthropy, not as charity, but as human beings who deserve all our support. 
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being, deserves what these children have gone through. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. 
That was after having spent about 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa. 
So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. 
And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. 
But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. 
I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish college system, so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. 
So I did a pretest when they came. 
And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: "Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?" 
And I put them together so that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child mortality of the other. 
And this means that it's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data. 
I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. 
And these were the results of the Swedish students. 
I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow. 
And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. 
That means there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course. 
(Laughter) But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. 
I have shown that Swedish top students know, statistically, significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. 
(Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. 
They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. 
The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas. 
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, which hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. 
(Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. 
Every bubble here is a country. 
This country over here is China. 
This is India. 
Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, "What do you really think about the world?" 
(Laughter) And they said, "The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is the Western world and 'them' is the Third World." 
"And what do you mean with 'Western world?'" I said. 
"Well, that's long life and small family. 
So this is what I could display here. 
I put fertility rate here -- number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. 
We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries. 
The error margin is narrow. 
Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries, up to about 70 years. 
And in 1962, there was really a group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. 
And these were the developing countries. 
Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. 
Are the students right? It's still two types of countries? 
Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? 
Or have they got longer lives and live up there? 
Let's see. We stopped the world then. 
This is all UN statistics that have been available. 
Here we go. Can you see there? 
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. 
Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. 
The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. 
This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. 
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. 
But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s -- the imams start to promote family planning, and they move up into that corner. 
And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries. 
And the rest of them all move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam. 
1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. 
And this is what happens. 
The data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. 
By the end of the year, family planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families. 
And the United States up there is getting longer life, keeping family size. 
And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. 
And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. 
I think we all, if we don't look at the data, we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economic change. 
So let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of income. 
This is the world distribution of income of people. 
One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. 
There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. 
There's a little hump here. 
But there are people all the way. 
And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent of the world's annual income. 
And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. 
And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. 
And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. 
We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. 
But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income. 
We heard it in other forms. 
And who are these? 
Where are the different countries? 
I can show you Africa. 
This is Africa. 
Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty. 
This is OECD -- the rich countries, the country club of the UN. 
And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. 
And this is Latin America. 
It has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. 
And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia. 
And what did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? 
And most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. 
The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. 
And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty, and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. 
And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. 
We'll have most people in the middle. 
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. 
We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. 
If I change this and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. 
And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. 
Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. 
In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. 
And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 
The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. 
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. 
I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. 
And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble is the size of the population. 
Sierra Leone down there, Mauritius is up there. 
Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America. 
There's a huge difference [within] Africa. 
And Ghana is here in the middle. 
Here in Uganda, development aid. 
Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. 
There's tremendous variation within Africa, which we very often make that it's equal everything. 
I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. 
But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. 
I can split Arab states. How are they? 
Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference. 
Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used. 
Not as the myth is. 
And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. 
Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. 
There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. 
The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. 
East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. 
And there is Latin America. 
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. 
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD. 
And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. 
And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. 
This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China. 
And then he died. 
And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world. 
But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. 
I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. 
The label went away for me here. 
And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. 
I can run it forward, like this. 
And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower. 
And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. 
And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. 
They came from here, a mineral country. 
They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. 
You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. 
You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. 
And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. 
In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. 
So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used it in the past. 
Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. 
That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. 
So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. 
If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. 
These are the quintiles of Uganda. 
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. 
The poorest are down there. 
If I split South Africa, it's like this. 
And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine [recently], it's like this. 
The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss what solutions there should be in Africa. 
Everything in this world exists in Africa. 
And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [treatment] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. 
The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level. 
We must be much more detailed. 
And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. 
Why are we not using the data we have? 
We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other nongovernmental organizations. 
Because the data is hidden down in the databases. 
And the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively. 
All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. 
There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics. 
(Laughter) And this won't work. 
(Applause) So what is needed? We have the databases. 
It's not a new database that you need. 
We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here. 
So we started a nonprofit venture linking data to design, we called "Gapminder," from the London Underground, where they warn you, "Mind the gap." 
So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. 
And it wasn't that difficult. 
You can take a data set and put it there. 
We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization. 
Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world. 
But what we really need is, of course, a search function, a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. 
And what do we hear when we go around? 
Everyone says, "It's impossible. This can't be done. 
Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. 
We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world." 
But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? 
And we would like flowers to grow out on the net. 
One of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there. 
And I have pretty good news for you. 
I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible. 
He only says, "We can't do it." 
(Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh? 
(Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. 
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. 
This is the income distribution of China, 1970. 
This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. 
Almost no overlap. 
And what has happened? 
What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it? 
(Laughter) It's pretty scary. 
We need really to see it. 
And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000. 
In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. 
It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. 
And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. 
Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. 
I end now with the world. 
There, the internet is coming. 
The number of internet users are going up like this. 
This is the GDP per capita. 
And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. 
That's why the $100 computer will be so important. 
But it's a nice tendency. 
It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? 
These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause)

(Applause) 

It is often said that the stories of history are written by its victors, but if this is true, what becomes of the downtrodden, and how can they ever hope to aspire for something greater if they are never told the stories of their own glorious pasts? 
Ostensibly, I stand before you as a mere maker of clothing, but within the folds of ancient fabrics and modern textiles, I have found a higher calling. 
Through my work as a designer, I've discovered the importance of providing representation for the marginalized members of our society, and the importance of telling the most vulnerable among us that they no longer have to compromise themselves just so they can fit in with an uncompromising majority. 
It turns out that fashion, a discipline many of us consider to be trivial, can actually be a powerful tool for dismantling bias and bolstering the self-images of underrepresented populations. 
My interest in using design as a vehicle for social change happens to be a personal one. 
As a Nigerian American, I know how easily the term "African" can slip from being an ordinary geographic descriptor to becoming a pejorative. 
For those of us from this beautiful continent, to be African is to be inspired by culture and to be filled with undying hope for the future. 
So in an attempt to shift the misguided perceptions that many have about the place of my birth, I use design as a means to tell stories, stories about joy, stories about triumph, stories about perseverance all throughout the African diaspora. 
I tell these stories as a concerted effort to correct the historical record, because, no matter where any of us is from, each of us has been touched by the complicated histories that brought our families to a foreign land. 
These histories shape the way we view the world, and they mold the biases we carry around with us. 
To combat these biases, my work draws aesthetics from different parts of the globe and crafts a narrative about the importance of fighting for inclusivity. 
By refashioning images from classic European art and marrying them with African aesthetics, I am able to recast people of color in roles of prominence, providing them with a degree of dignity they didn't have in earlier times. 
This approach subverts the historically accepted narrative of African inferiority, and it serves as inspiration for people of color who have grown wary of seeing themselves depicted without sophistication and without grace. 
Each of these culture-bending tapestries becomes a tailored garment or a silk scarf, like the one I am very coincidentally wearing right now. 
(Laughter) And even when surrounded in a structure of European classicism, these narratives boldly extoll the merits of African empowerment. 
In this way, the tools of the masters become masterworks to celebrate those who were once subservient. 
This metaphor extends beyond the realm of art and out into the real world. 
Whether worn by refugees or world-changing entrepreneurs, when people are allowed the freedom to present themselves in a manner that celebrates their own unique identities, a magical thing happens. 
We stand taller. 
We're more proud and self-aware because we're presenting our true, authentic selves. 
And those of us who are around them in turn become more educated, more open and more tolerant of their different points of view. 
In this way, the clothes that we wear can be a great illustration of diplomatic soft power. 
The clothes that we wear can serve as bridges between our seemingly disparate cultures. 
And so, yeah, ostensibly I stand before you as a mere maker of clothing. 
But my work has always been about more than fashion. 
It has become my purpose to rewrite the cultural narratives so that people of color can be seen in a new and nuanced light, and so that we, the proud children of sub-Saharan Africa, can traverse the globe while carrying ourselves with pride. 
It was indeed true that the stories of history were told by its old victors, but I am of a new generation. 
My work speaks for those who will no longer let their futures be dictated by a troubled past. 
Today, we stand ready to tell our own stories without compromise, without apologies. 
But the question still remains: are you prepared for what you are about to hear? 
I hope you are, because we are coming regardless. 
(Applause)
