A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days.
It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life. There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.
Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges. I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days.
No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist." (Laughter) So here's one last thing I'd like to mention.
When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this. (Laughter) So here's my question to you:
(Applause)
(Applause) My name is Aisha Chaudhary and I'm 15 years old. I was born with an immune deficiency, with a life expectancy of only one year.
Are you searching a job for 10 years?
Sir...please, offer me this job sir
I feel ashamed to be jobless. I beg you sir.
Are you begging here?
Look at your face.
Make a living as a porter. Who allowed you inside?
I'll come without biscuit, nest time. What a great office! Street dog is conducting interviews.
I heard your wife has eloped with your driver. People are saying.
This job suits you well.
Ganesh! Attending an interview again?
Stop boy! Get me a pack of cigarettes.
I'll give you 25 paise.
I can forget if I drink, but it'll not allow me...
lf I forget, I can drink, but I can't forget...
Man's life is like this only...
A man with heart can never live in peace...
I warned him a lot but he didn't listen to me.
lnstead of seeing him, I prefer sleeping on road. Uncle, Ganesh too is starving.
Cheap drink, even buttermilk isn't working on it.
I need Rs.100, for application.
I don't have.
- Why? It's my money.
My TV
Will any man live in this house?
Who said you're a man?
Am I a dog then?
A dog follows the order's loyally.
- Only fools dream.
What the hell did you achieve in life?
For 30 years the same teacher's job without any change.
Are you advising me about life?
I am bearing you for 30 years.
lsn't that a great achievement?
The brief you're wearing isn't earned by you.
Men of your age have studied well,
Got married, living happily with kids. What about you?
You're still licking my ass.
A son is one who takes care of aged old parent.
Not one who lives all his life on father's old shoulders
Thank God!
I have a job for decent living.
lf not you would've killed me long back.
My sight has diminished. I'm not able to stand for more than 10 minutes. I'm coughing all the night.
Do you know how many times, I'm visiting hospital in a week?
Sons like you're useful only to cremate parents.
Take...Rs.100
Buy application...or buy drinks or go to a prostitute.
Slow...slowly.
What happened to me today? What's this new commotion in my heart? Shining garland of clouds...
Which sculptor's masterpiece is this statue? Her beauty is all new to me...
Her beauty is making my eyes to forget to bat...
A new strange passion is taking over me...
Unforgettable magic... Feeling very thirsty in pouring rain...
A rainbow has descended on earth in gentle rain... It lost sheen seeing her luminous beauty... Her beauty is pulling me towards her...
When a dawn is visiting at midnight before me...
My mischievous eyes broke into a joy... Rain drops are getting wet and dancing happily...
My heart broke into a song happily... My body danced in a trance...
When I see her beauty... I'm sleepless... When she sees me, myheart can't take the thrill...
I forgot the world as my dream come true...
First time I saw a lighting...
I rushed &amp; gushed towards her like a sea on high tide...
What's this? ls the world coming to an end? I'll come...l'll come fast... I've to study now.
lsn't her speech sensational?
No...always like this only.
I feel like I know everything, but I can't remember it.
Think peacefully without tension
ls he calling me to make fun?
What? What happened?
It seems my son has passed the written test. Still he has to pass group discussion &amp; interview.
- Did I ask you?
You speak.
Say something other than yeah!
What's your problem?
I'm not fluent in English.
It seems he has passed the group discussion too.
He called me there as he's feeling nervous.
How many more tests?
Anyway, you'll fail again there.
Why to waste time here? Come let's go home. Will you shut your job?
I said any companion not you.
I must beat myself with slippers for coming here leaving my work.
Sorry, you're wearing shoes today.
She's going away. Come on say.
Madam...that's... you please carry on...
Why are you so elated?
Were you sure I'm useless?
I did feel like all these days.
Did you ever get yourself a job?
Suddenly when I heard you passed a test with software solutions...- You...
I saw your lousy face. I'll not get this job.
Not selected, right?
Forget it. It's a great achievement that you've come so far. Come.
I must buy a good watch.
You retire immediately father. Take rest at house. Why do you want to work?
What did you say? - Are you mad, dad?
Should I retire?
Become your maid servant, cooking, washing &amp; serving you.
Even to buy a medicine or biscuit I've to beg you. I'll never depend on anyone.
I'll live on my own.
lf a situation comes like that,
You're not talking to me again.
Relationship of father and son is snapped from this moment. Go...go away.
What did I say now to make you so furious?
Again same words.
I'll kill you...stop...stop.
Why is he sleeping so early? Make him up.
Get up...get up...Vasu...
- What's it. I got a job. I got a job....
She's a different girls. Come.
Have you forgotten me?
On the interview day...
Was it you also who spoke in Telugu in the group discussion?
You helped me a lot that day...
But from now onwards only English will do here.
This isn't a school to start from alphabets.
Why do you unnecessarily get shouted by her? I can't understand anything.
She'll not tell anything patiently.
I fear she may beat me in anger.
It seems she's the most strict officer here. And you got struck with her.
Take this basic study material.
Nothing...you carry on.
Did she look at me?
Did she?
Did she see or was it hallucination?
I feel like trains are chugging in &amp; out of my heart.
She'll not look at me.
Bloody, I can never understand this.
Why did you allot him project without proper training?
ls it a playground to play as you wish?
lf you don't like doing job, stay at home.
I've to deliver it by tomorrow.
Withered leaves turned into flowers when you walk on them... Even crows turned into poets seeing your beauty...
For your dreams...
For your tales... It's happiness all over...
Praising me beautifully... Asking me something later... You've created ripples in my serene pond like heart...
Talk to me a word affectionately...
Walk a step with me...
It'll be a cherished memory for all my births... I must take refuge atleast once in your lap... Sleep on your heart once...
She'll definitely say no. Don't leave her till she accepts my love.
One more important thing Tell her I don't know anything about this phone call.
Do you want to escape making us scapegoats? No, I've to adjust now for further problems. Coins!
You go on talk to her, I'll insert coins continuously.
I've auditing in my office, I'll take leave. Bye.
I'm down with dysentery. I've to consult doctor. Bye.- Bye.
lf you don't call her now on phone, I'll never see you guys again.
Ganesh, try to understand us.
This is a matter of your life.
I can talk any nonsense. Seenu is a brave man.
He has good rapport with girls. Your love will succeed.
We'll deliver it at home.
Why did you say bank?
I'm scared buddy.
I can't do it. I'll be embarrassed if this leaks out.
A police in criminal act.
They will spit on my face.
No need of all this, come. I don't know how you do it, you must tell her.
My brain is heated.
lf you don't tell her, I'll kill you.
Keerthi, phone for you again
Hello, I'm Ganesh speaking.
I'm Ganesh's friend Seenu speaking.
Oh!
I told her my name.
He loves me. No...he loves you.
lf you refuse, I'll die.
No...no...he'll die.
Next...next...what next?
He has written your name all over his room.
I don't know anything about this phone call.
No...you don't know.
Oh my God!
Actually Ganesh doesn't know anything about this phone call. I haven't seen him for a month.
Tell me whether you love him or not?
Then...l'm not a policeman, I'm a beggar in Railway station.
Ganesh loves me?
- Yes.
Thank God!
That's it.
She got the message, Ganesh.
No...Naresh...Mahesh...Suresh...
Tell Ganesh, if he has courage, come &amp; express love to me.
Tell bravely. Okay. I'll tell her.
Do you've a friend named Seenu?
Oh no...No...l don't have any friend? ln fact I don't have friends.
What was the name you said? Seenu?
Seenu? What a lousy name?
Nobody will befriend such a man.
Where were you last night?
Last night? I slept off after reaching house from office.
No...l got news about my grandpa's death.
I went to my native place... I wasn't in Hyderabad at all...
Some one used your name and made a silly phone call.
I'll kill him. You told me, right?
By the way... what did he say on the phone?
He said you've gone mad and taking you to mental asylum.
Did he say that?- Then, you've to go to Australia for a new project.
Who are the 3?
You, Balu sir and Daniel.
- No I'll not go.
How can I leave you and...
I mean how can I go leaving you all here?
Take care of the project till we come back.
You mean...you are also going.
Which place did you say?
Australia? I want to see Australia.
Just now you said you can't leave all these people behind.
I can live as long as possible.
Don't go overboard.
You'll fall flat on face.
Jealousy! Master!
Till now you'd worked for so many years
Did you ever cross Hyderabad?
Ganesh, for Rs.2000, you can. Rs.2000? It's unjust.
Many others are in the queue.. ls it a joke to sit next to Keerthi? One day, one night, Keerthi next to you.
How lucky one must be to enjoy it?
People are offering Rs.5000 or Rs.10000. Leave me.
Take it.
- Respect for me is diminishing.
God save me
You next to me?
Fasten the belt.
- I've already fastened it. Look
I had to do all this for Satan Balu.
Balu, have it.
Why are you feeling shy now?
I can't understand lndian English and you're too much.
- How can I ask her?
He'll ask.
Tell her. We come rarely to foreign country.
Shouldn't we see the places?
No use of going to hotel room now
Yes, what a great dancer she is!
What are you drinking - Orange juice.
You!
- What?
Same height, same weight, same face.
Everything same!
What's going on?
I'll beat you black &amp; blue.
I'll kill all of you.
What's this? Look.
You...
Come...let's play.
Entire bottle? Rascal!
I will...
Where are you rushing?
- Leave me...l'll kill him.
Who are you man?
You don't remember me too.
I'll kill you... be ware.
I'm coming. I'll kill you... I'm coming.
How can I leave her in this condition?
lf you go away, I'll also go out.
What are you doing in my room?
Nightdress
You had drinks and threw up.
So I had to clean &amp; stay back.
Don't you remember anything that happened last night?
Who are you to do change my dress?
I didn't change but a lady worker did it sending me out.
Couldn't you go out after that?
Why did you stay in the room? You will ask now. You forced me stay here only.
Did I ask you to stay in my room? Don't lie.
Look, you slept like a log.
I was here like as a security guard.
Believe it or not.
Your wish.
My girl's eyes have a net of charm...
You're man's pride...
You're killing me with desire...
Pinch my cheeks...
Be a guest on my bed...
Don't lure and trap me with your sensuous beauty...
If I lose control, your youth willget devastated.
If you're such a macho man, why don't you come with me?
Come fast...take me in your arms... Leave your marks of love on me...
Don't rush my dear.
You trap us with your beauty...
Please...in an emotion...
Please don't mistake me. I wanted to express it well.
But situation of my family is totally different
Very strict lf my grandfather comes to know this, he'll kill me
I can't accept love... ....why am I telling you all this? Leave me alone.
The way you look. No...no...you love me.
Don't hide it.
Leave my hand. Leave my hand.
Switch off the light. - Why? I said no, leave it
You should tell me before, I've already cooked.
Take it. Don't shout.
What happened son?
Ain't I asking you?
Won't you let me live in peace? Why do you torture me?
Tell me...as if you've lost the world.
Yes...indeed I've lost my world.
For a girl...
I created a new world in my heart.
Carefully...beautifully... a large one...lt's gone.
A girl rejected your son's love.
She's getting married what am I to do?
It's love... how can you understand?
Go...l'll be with you till death.
I'm Ganesh's father
Tell me.
- I want to talk to you personally.
Why did you send your father to the office?
I didn't send him. He's here...he's talking to Keerthi madam? I mustn't praise my own son.
- Don't you've any sense?
How can you talk like this with a stranger girl?
Your son had earlier took me into his arms in public...
Do you know what's the gossip going around in my office?
You both know very well my marriage is fixed.
Are you humans or...?
Your son fell short by 2 marks in the interview...
I felt pity and got him this job.
ls it the way both father &amp; son show the gratitude?
What's this?
He asked you out of affection on me. He's an elderly man.
Can't you explain him patiently? Why are you shouting at him?
Should I watch mutely your irresponsible behavior?
This foolish man... I'll not take one more harsh word against him.
I have been watching you, wagging your tongue.
Don't you know that I'm following you all these days?
Don't you know how I was admiring you?
Why create a scene here?
Let the fight be within us.
Say sorry to him.
One more word and I'll burn your face with acid. ...say sorry to him
What's this? - Father!
I'll kill you.
Ganesh, don't get angry.
Listen to me...
All are watching us. It's not good...come with me...come.
Keerthi, don't cry.
Don't say cheers and mar my respect.
It's been 20 years I had a drink.
I feel it's little strong. May I add little soda? - No.
Do you drink regularly?
No father, sometimes when I'm sad.
Don't get addicted. It's not good for health.
Shall we go to the doctor?
Your face looks swollen.
Strong girl.
I would've become normal, there are many other girls on road.
No father, she slapped you.
I don't mind going to jail for killing her.
Did she slap me? ln that commotion, her hand hit my face.
Think from her side, yesterday the son and today the father.
Who will not get angry if we pester her to love you?
She's a good girl I can judge by looking at her.
Won't you eat anything?
I brought biryani.
No.
I feel giddy...I'll go to sleep.
Father...father...be careful.
Leave me. Have I grown old?
People are ready to give their daughters in marriage to me even now.
Do you've such ideas at this age?
Are you still feeling sad, son?
You had to face all this for me.
Yes dad
You got so furious on seeing me getting slapped.
Do you love me so much? Why are you asking me that? Okay then, don't tell me.
Suddenly when you asked...
- I asked casually.
Father...- Go.
I'm confused.
What man?
How did this happen?
He was fine last night, by morning he's....
Why?
Let me arrange my dad's funeral with my earnings.
Father, what did you cook?
We are coming from LlC.
Your father had taken a policy for Rs.10 lakhs on your name.
Please sign the documents.
I killed you.
I killed you. lf I hadn't fallen in love with that girl...
You would be living now, dad.
His time came and he left the world.
How can you think of him and stop living?
Did you have anything?
Please eat. Eat...eat I say.
Eat...eat...eat...
Eat I say.
Do you also want to die?
Give it to me. Eat...eat...
I don't see Keethu, may be she has boarded another coach.
Keep the bag down. It'll be comfortable for 3.
- Okay. Where are you going too? - I want to go, leave me...
Are you mad enough to jump from a speeding train? What happened now?
Don't you want to attend my marriage?
lf you don't come with me now...
I want you to live peacefully away from Hyderabad. You're acting high...come.
What?
- Come here for a moment. Wait...l'll come.
- Come, I say. Come...one more word...
I'll not consider our friendship too.
Why is he here?
No...but...you know about our family,
Why is everyone talking about problems?
His father died suddenly.
lf I leave him, he'll go mad.
When did his father die?
- 4 days ago. Poor man died with heart attack.
You're the sweetness of my world...
you became a flower and spread fragrance...
You turned into a thorn and pricked my heart...
You spread light in my life like a lightning...
You buried my dreams striking like a thunder... Is love a journey of tears?
Is trouble the destination of love?
Love warned me not to enter its world of destruction...
And paid a heavy price for it...
You smashed my world...
My body was hidden safely like in a temple...
But Goddess' garland has become a noose to me...
I lost belief in love...
I want to go to a world devoid of love...
I must reach a place you can never even dream of...
He said he'll think of it after marriage. So, we ran away from home just days before marriage.
I rented a room and she joined a hostel... We took up jobs.
Everyone at house accepted us. But grandpa stopped talking to us since then.
He didn't worry much about me.
But he dotes her.
She lost her mother at birth. so, grandpa and all others took special care her. we came here last year too.
Grandpa didn't enter house till we were here. This marriage is too cool his temper. I think this will cool him.
Why didn't you introduce her to me? How many times should I ask her?
She decided not to meet any of my friend. She thinks she's very intelligent. She gets angry if I go to meet her.
Tell him not to come before me. - Okay. He's too much.
- Please bear it for me. She's bright like a bride, right?
May you live like a Goddess.
Move...drink boost.- No. Move...move...l haven't yet seen my niece.
How are you dad? - You wait. Kusumamba!
I got this from town especially for you. Take it. By next year you must gift us a baby, Kusumamba.
Kusumamba? - My grandma's name. That's her real name.
She changed it to Keerthi for city folks. Come, let's go in.
Haven't you seen a man till now? What a family! Oh God!
Enough Prasunamba
My name is Pooja
That is...l got it.
ls the entire family mad?
Oh! What's this?
- What? What's this outfit?
Shouldn't I take bath?
- So what?
You must take bath here like this only.
No bathrooms here.
Undress and tie this. This looks very small size.
No need, I'll take a bath tomorrow morning.
You mustn't enter house without bath, grandma will shout. Hey short fat boy!
One rag on head and you'll get 2 inches shorter. I'm not used to a loin-cloth.
- Than take a bath without it.
Bloody
How dare you beat me? lf you say something now, I'll strangle your neck.
I won't take bath.
Go to hell. He's hardly above the ground but shouting at me.
Father-in-law, please bless the children.
Don't beat me. - What's now?
Get up sir.
Nobody must sleep here after the rooster crows. Get out.
- Please come out sir. lf old man comes to know, he'll create a scene.
What's all this?
Thank God! Coffee has come.
What's this?
Neem leaf extract. - What leaf?
Grandpa's rule to have it every morning.
Why are you kicking?
- What's everyone doing? 10 minutes walk for free motions.
Grandpa's rule.
Walking? Here!
What's this?
He's a pain.
Where is everyone going?
Don't you want to go to toilet?
- For that? Everything is open air here.
Grandpa's rule.
How many bathrooms can we build for this large family?
Don't ask silly questions. Come.
What a family!
It's a hell.
How can any man go to toilet in this chill weather?
We'll not know even if any snake passes.
What?
I'm finished.
Where's water?
Shouldn't I clear my doubt?
We can wash in the pond later. What leaves?
Where am I to find leaves in darkness?
Why is sitting pants down still? May be new to the place.
Bloody rogues! Where have you all gone?
Shameless creature.
- Did you see?
Bloody!
You're killing me.
What a nasty family.
I want to talk to you. Please don't see me like a criminal. I feel like killing myself.
Your father died because of me.
I don't even have the right to seek your forgiveness.
A good man died because of me.
Please don't cry.
Nobody can help it.
How many are lucky to have such peaceful death?
He'll be happily singing duets with my mother in heaven.
lf you feel embarrassed for my presence, tell me, I'll go away.
Your presence is not a problem to me.
What's it dear?
Aunty, that is...Ganesh's....
Silly girl.
Ask Mangaiah!
- Please have it dear.
ls there anything to eat?
Why are you feeling shy to ask?
This is also your house.
Why are you still watching fun?
Come...have it hot.
Grandma...
Old woman is like that only. You come in. Why are you watching without blinking?
Won't you take care of guests?
No...l can't eat so much. Can you leave this place without finishing it?
Yes, have it Ganesh.
Why are you feeling shy?
Have it son.
Few more?
What are your parents doing back home?
You're also like Vasu to us.
You must come here every summer vacation.
Got it!
It's my order.
The fragrance of earth...
How do people have a heart to leave all this?
Still you can't beat the city life.
Aren't you ashamed to watch? Go and work!
Wearing dark glasses like a blind man.
Cut it like this. ls your grandpa educated? - He did BA.
No use of it.
Workers must do this.
I think your grandpa is a miser. What's the discussion going on here?
Nothing.- He said it seems we mustn't do all this work.
It must be done by workers and you're a country brute.
Not only that he said you're a miser and a fool. It seems you're a psycho. It seems you're torturing all of us.
He said you've grown old but not wise.
Yes, I heard him say all this. - Yes, grandpa. My fate!
My father too never hit me so severely
Rogues! ls it a family?
Bloody family. My bad time, I'm here.
A snake guard here?
I'll show them what I am.
You must fear me.
Am I a joke to you?
Why is the guard hissing?
Will it hiss?
He's damn scared.
Please don't get scared...
What happened?
He got scared seeing a snake. Our kids here play with it.
Girls!
Let it get cooked well or else it'll smell raw.- Okay sir.
I'm coming straight here after chopping off your lawyer's hand.
How dare you send me a notice?
Shut up you buffalo!
It's our ancestral property.
You took it on lease, do you want to usurp it?
Get out or else I'll call police.
- Police? Me? Madam greetings
What'll you do if I refuse?
I'll put my hand in full public glare.
...not on you. ...on your women folk.
You won't be like patient.
You're going overboard.
Stop.
You'll not listen to words.
Kill anyone who dares to come near me.
Catch him.
Who are you to support them? Hey old man!
Are you running a brothel house with your woman?
Go!...Hit him.
Sorry sir.
I'm scared of snakes but not to pigs like him.
Say you've forgiven me sir.
Forgive me.
Okay...okay
Move...move...
What should I do get muscles like you?
Bloody.
What are you doing here? What are you doing here?
Bossing over me?
Get out. You're wanted downstairs.
This isn't good.
Welcome Prasunamba
Oh Pooja!
I'm open type &amp; ultra modern.
- Okay.
I can't hide my feelings.
I started liking you the moment I saw you.
Later on when you said you've no one,
I liked your simple innocent heart.
I liked your innocence when you got scared seeing a snake.
Above all this you fought for this family's honor.
I've decided you're perfect match to me
What is it?
No means no...l don't like it.
She's a little girl. - I know.
Some attraction.
ln time it will wear.
No need for this
Call me at dinner time.
Lord Narayana's feet in my refuge...
Won't you talk to me?
Go away donkey!
I can't sing. No, listen to me. I can't sing.
All are asking you, come on sing.
Yes, come sing.
Your wife's request.
Oh Brother-in-law is feeling shy.
Dear...please sing...come on.
- Shut up.
Think about your wife and sing
I can't.
Wait...wait...Why are you fixing me? I'm going. No.
Don't embarrass me.
Please for my sake say okay.
My friend will sing now instead of me. About Keerthi!
Look how beautiful she is!
Sing about her. Sing.
Has the star of sky descended on earth like you?
Like a rare gem...
like Goddess in a temple...
Presiding over my heart...
Earth hasn't seen anyone till now like her...
Won't the man who marries this wealth of beauty be Lord Sri Hari...
A garden grown with so many people's affection...
Won't it become a celestial garden of flowers?
Making the beauty more beautiful...
Is she a gift from the heaven?
What man? Children, Look! She's scared.
This young woman with her beauty...
She pulled everyone towards her...
This river with so many bends &amp; curves...
Don't know who's heart she has drowned in her...
First meeting as a sweet dream...
It's a cherished memory of heart...
Won't every memory bless her...
Spreading light in my lover's life...
She was fine. She never got up even late morning also.
She wanted to see Keerthi's marriage.
Sir, please do something. I can't do anything.
She has grown old, I don't know what's in her mind. She's struggling to breath her last. They are trying everything.
Grandma! I've entered your room. Wont' you beat me?
Nobody cared when you were alive. But how they are asking you what you want. What to do grandma?
I was also like them only. I came to the value of my father after his death.
I don't know about others.
But I like you very much.
True. Whenever you chased me with a stick to beat... ...it made me remember my father.
I'll leave it on you.
Come. They are going to read the marriage invitation.
Come...come.
We are going to buy saris, will you come with us? A thorn has entered my leg. It's paining.
Woman's words have different meaning...
Not very long...
Women's laugh has different meaning...
Women's looks have different meaning...
Women's silence has different meaning...
Where did you go away?
Won't this color look gorgeous on Keerthi?
This one, no way. Green silk sari.
With a matching blouse, with hair let down,
When she comes walking, she'll be like one angel.
Keerthi, you too selected the same green sari Ganesh selected.
- Not yet.
Aunty sent this milk for you.
Shall I go away from here?
True, if I stay here, you'll think of the past.
No need of unnecessary trouble. I'll go away.
Go away...
Why so early morning?
- Don't say another word.
I've to join office. It's urgent. I may lose my job.
Children may cry if they know, tell them later.
Get ready hot water.
I'm having body pain.
Tell him &amp; go.
Urgent work is pending in office, I've to go.
Thanks for taking good care of me One minute
Did anyone insult you? - No sir. Then, can't you stay till Keerthi's marriage?
lf I stay back, It'll create problem. Bye grandma.
Take care of your health. Please uncle, don't go...
How can you do like this?
lf you're any grouse you should come to me.
Come...come...
Uncle, he's bowling very fast. - Don't bowl fast to him. Bowl slowly...
I'm taking care of children.
You take her, I'll look the children.
Check your mails yourself, why should I come? Children, you continue play.
Let's go.
I've to talk personally with Ganesh. What will you talk?
About my matter?
Yes...yes...you go out. - My great sister.
Still further
Matter has become serious.
Yes, I'm facing new problems.
You talk to her and put an end to it. Poor child! She'll cry.
She's very determined to achieve what she desires.
lf my people come to know it, it'll lead to problem.
You finish it today itself.
Pooja...stop.
Doctor...Pooja, Take her to hospital.
I'm a great sinner. Shut up
My sister.. - Shut up and sit silently.
Give me your hands.
Give.
lf you shout again I'll kill you. Press...come on
This is not love, it's attraction.
Got me?
Keerthi! ls she beautiful?
ls she beautiful?
Tell me.
ln 5 years, youth of this place will go mad on you.
You'll get 10 love letters everyday.
Not only me, even Shahrukh or Salman Khan will fall for you.
Would you like to die without seeing all this?
Die...come I'll push you.
- Will I surely get a man like you?
Better than me.
- Answer my question.
Will he keep me happy like you do?
Will he be a good man like you?
Yes.
Then okay.
Sit in the front seat.
We all came to the same marriage in the same town. We are the bride's guests.
What?
He's Keerthi's fiance.
lsn't he smart?
Why are you surprised? She's Keerthi. Vasu's bride
You might be tired.
Take rest.
Guest house is in the next street. Mangaiah, take them.
Come madam.
Why are you going with them?
I'll spend sometime happily with them.
Tell him.
Will you remain like a statue? Silence is broken... Where are you?
Why did you come here now?
I was just...
But I came here without thinking about anything.
I feel like I'm dying if I don't see you for few minutes.
Or did I hide the feelings in fear?
I am confused. Tomorrow I'm getting married.
Have I gone mad?
Please...
It happens in everyone's life.
You were brought up in an orthodox family.
What should I do now?
Will you come &amp; seek my hand from my family?
You are a bride now.
People will misunderstand if you're seen here.
Why?
Are you still thinking about your father's death?
No...nothing like that.
Then?
Now you're taking revenge keeping it in mind, right?
Why are you hesitating now? Can't you talk to my people?
They'll spit on me for cheating them.
Above all my friend Vasu...
He brought me here to keep me happy.
Do you want me to spoil his happiness?
I don't mind losing you.
But I can't lose a family &amp; friend.
ls this your decision?
What can I say now!
It's my bad luck to miss a man like you.
You'll also marry someone, won't you?
No, this is enough.
Marriage will settle all issues.
Keep smiling.
It's good for health.
Grandpa.
- Don't come near me. Your breath also shouldn't reach me.
All I want to know is one thing only. Were you spoiled mentally or else...
Do you know how people see women of this family? Like Goddesses!
How dare to enter this house again?
Get out.- Uncle!
Disloyal dog. Keerthi isn't such a girl.
What did you do to her?
What game did you play to change her?
So cheaply.
Get out.
Never again show your face to me.
I was just feeling happy about getting a family.
I just came to say bye to Vasu.
You blamed me a lot.
After this you'll not believe anything I say.
But I can say confidently one thing.
Keerthi is also as chaste as she is.
lf liking a man is a sin, then, every girl is a sinner in this world.
Even if I insist on eloping, she'll not come.
Grandma, take care of health.
Sky will not retain a drop of rain for itself...
It happily give it to earth...
Will sea's thirst subside after drinking up all the rivers?
Don't lock friendship in a cage? Sending a palanquin, bless happily...
Won't your memories turn into tears?
Your journey is lovely...
Love, pacify my troubled heart...
How can he survive?
Sir, your guest Ganesh...
- Don't you've sense?
Sir.
See to it. - Okay.
Vasu, I need money!
You come with it, I'll get clothes.
I'll come with you.
What can we do if they don't believe us?
Come...come....
I'll also come. Don't go son-in-law. Why are the children going away?
- Stop...stop.
Please forgive us, father-in-law.
We are also angry on him.
But he doesn't have anyone.
You're a God. Don't get angry. Lakshmi, what's this?
He's near to you than all others.
You needn't sit.
lf I wanted to go, I would've gone long back.
You didn't raise me like that.
Do you think I'm sitting here half-heartedly?
I'm happy.
I liked him very much and asked him to talk with you.
I'll not get up from here, till Vasu comes &amp; marries me.
Ask the newspaper man to deliver weekly magazines. What's that look?
We have given you our daughter. Bloody filthy! - Grandma.
Oh God! My fate. Will any human like here?
Briefs, loincloth and every dirty things is in bathroom.
Bloody family! No Holy Basil plant here.
No prayer's room. They are killing me.
Why don't you coming to do exercise?
I've been doing it since morning. Okay, get me a glass of cold water. - You too.
You came as guest and stole our girl.
Last night up till 3 am...
Look at your face. Go to work.
I'm your husband.
Why are you shouting at me?
Husband?
Feeling pity on you, they got me married to you.
You can't buy a car but...
Sorry, we are not used to toilets.
So we went out.
Won't you talk to me?
The cofounder of the social, news, and entertainment website "Reddit" has been found dead.
He certainly was a prodigy, although he never kinda thought of himself like that. He was totally unexcited about starting businesses and making money.
There is a profound sense of loss tonight in Highland Park, Aaron Swartz's hometown as loved ones say goodbye to one of the Internet's brightest light. Freedom, Open Access, and computer activists are mourning his loss. "An astonishing intellect," if you talk to people who knew him.
And the answer is that Breadth - First Search always considers the shortest paths first, and in this case, there's 2 paths of length 1, and 1, the paths from Arad to Zerind and Arad to Timisoara, so those would be the 2 paths that would be considered.
So the correct answer is all of those-- finance, robotics, games, medicine, the Web, and many more applications. So let me talk about them in some detail. There is a huge number of applications of artificial intelligence in finance, very often in the shape of making trading decisions-- in which case, the agent is called a trading agent.
AI has a huge history in games-- to make games smarter or feel more natural. There are 2 ways in which AI has been used in games, as a game agent. One is to play against you, as a human user.
There's an entire sub-field of artificial intelligence to use AI to make characters in a game more believable--look smarter, so to speak-- so that you, as a player, think you're playing a better game. Artificial intelligence has a long history in medicine as well. The classic example is that of a diagnostic agent.
AI is used in intensive care to understand whether there are situations that need immediate attention. It's been used for life-long medicine to monitor signs over long periods of time. And as medicine becomes more personal, the role of artificial intelligence will definitely increase.
The most generic version of AI is to crawl the Web and understand the Web, and assist you in answering questions.
So when you have this search box over here and it says "Search" on the left, and "I'm Feeling Lucky" on the right, and you type in the words, what AI does for you is it understands what words you typed in and finds the most relevant pages. That is really co-artificial intelligence. It's used by a number of companies, such as Microsoft and Google and Amazon, Yahoo, and many others.
When you then come and issue a query, the AI system is able to give you a response-- for example, a collection of 10 best Web links. In short, every time you try to write a piece of software, that makes your computer software smart likely you will need artificial intelligence.
So, we've looked at 2 search algorithms. One, breadth-first search, in which we always expand first the shallowest paths, the shortest paths. Second, cheapest-first search, in which we always expand first the path with the lowest total cost.
Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college.
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives. On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis. Right?
It's understanding data. I think if our students, if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics, we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today.
I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling. It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics. In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus,
Here are the answers. Breadth-first search, as the name implies, expands nodes in this order. One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Our description of the algorithm has talked about paths in the state space. I want to say a little bit now about how to implement that in terms of a computer algorithm. We talk about paths, but we want to implement that in some ways.
silence shared in words presents My God! There Is No God!
"Father, have you forsaken me?" A great doubt must have arisen in him, a great question. Nothing is happening, and he was believing all these years that God would come to save him, his only begotten son.
OSHO Osho International Foundation presents Osho:
"If you are in a desert and thirsty and I have a full bottle of water, how much will you be ready to pay for it?" Alexander said,
"I will pay half my empire in such a situation." But the master said, "I will not sell until you pay me the full empire. Why should I sell?
"Perhaps I will give the whole empire." The master laughed.
So let's expand the node at Pitesti. We have to go down this direction, up, then we reach a path we've seen before, and we go in this direction. Now we reach Bucharest, which is the goal, and the h value is going to be 0 because we're at the goal, and the g value works out to 418.
Given the non-optimality of depth-first search, why would anybody choose to use it? Well, the answer has to do with the storage requirements. Here I've illustrated a state space consisting of a very large or even infinite binary tree.
Now, we're trying to build an artificial intelligence that can solve problems like this all on its own. You can see that the search algorithms do a great job of finding solutions to problems like this. But, you might complain that in order for the search algorithms to work, we had to provide it with a heurstic function.
"a block can move from A to B if A is adjacent to B," and that's equal to our heurstic h2 because a block can move anywhere to an adjacent state. Now, we could also cross out the other part of the rule, and we now get "a block can move from any square A to any square B regardless of any condition. That gives us heurstic h1.
Once we've generated automatically these candidate heuristics, another way to come up with a good heurstic is to say that a new heurstic, h, is equal to the maximum of h1 and h2, and that's guaranteed to be admissible as long as h1 and h2 are admissible because it still never overestimates, and it's guaranteed to be better because its getting closer to the true value. The only problem with combining multiple heuristics like this is that there is some cause to compute the heuristic and it could take longer to compute even if we end up expanding pure paths. Crossing out parts of the rules like this is called "generating a relaxed problem."
 All right, problem 79. What is the domain of the function shown on the graph below?
The answer is that it depends on the h function. A-star will find the lowest-cost path if the h function for a state is less than the true cost of the path to the goal through that state. In other words, we want the h to never overestimate the distance to the goal.

I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times. I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar.
"You must become the change you wish to see in the world." And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior" is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
And we have one. I have been trying to tell this story for a long time. I was reminded of that recently, by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at, just staring at me as she walked past.
Many years ago, when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race. And the military historians taught me, during that quest, that military conflicts are typically put into three categories: local battles, regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important global, world war -- strategic conflicts.
Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox. This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory. This is what's happened in the last 28 years.
Already, around the Arctic Circle -- this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica.
I want to share briefly a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun. It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSl:
"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent." The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was
"more than 90 percent." Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun." If that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress, but here is the key: when given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates: two of them were about the climate crisis. ABC:
844 questions, two about the climate crisis. Fox: two. CNN: two.
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s. '70s.
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet. Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge, to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible. What a burden we have." I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form -- one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true.
When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's -- are you excited by their plans on global warming?
The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --
There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly. So we have to have a change in consciousness. A change in commitment.
Thank you very much.
I am in Navdanya's Seed Bank where for more that 25 years with love and with care we have been saving every seed we come across. It's a place that gives me the deepest of joy, the deepest of hope, the deepest of peace. PEACE: because there isn't conflict here, either between the plants or for the plants; it's a community seed bank to be shared as a commons.
"We will make our own salt, we will not obey". Unjust laws should not be obeyed and 2nd October 2013 should be a celebration of non-cooperation with unjust laws for seed slavery in order to have Seed Freedom. And 16th October is World Food Day.
Before that we must march on 12th of October repeating the March Against Monsanto, going right up to their gates everywhere telling them: "You can buy the Blackwaters of the world, you can put out intelligence to hound each scientist and activist. We are not afraid.
[Male narrator] So we move on, we look for another shortest path. There's one path left of length 1, so we look at that path, we expand it, add in this path, put that one on the explored list, and now we've got 3 paths of length 2.
So congratulations, you just finished unit 1. You just finished unit 1 of this class, where I told you about key applications of artificial intelligence, I told you about the definition of an intelligent agent,
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. The truth of the matter is otherwise. Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters, and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala, the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful," or, as Sir Richard Burton -- not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor, but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature -- translates it.
"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God." And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion -- in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion," or, "reigned himself in by compassion" -- therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion, activators of compassion, actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?
"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's," -- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos." And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.
"until I love him or love her. And when I love my servant," God says, "I become the eyes by which he or she sees, the ears by which he or she listens, the hand by which he or she grasps, and the foot by which he or she walks, and the heart by which he or she understands."

It will be good to introduce some basic terminology that is commonly used in artificial intelligence to distinguish different types of problems. The very first word I will teach you is fully versus partially observable. An environment is called fully observable if what your agent can sense at any point in time is completely sufficient to make the optimal decision.
What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want.
But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. So let's pull up, now, something else. This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out.
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets -- this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology,
And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way.
(Applause) (Applause ends) You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft.
(Laughter) I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones --
So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on.
Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment.
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together. Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts.
(Applause) (Applause ends) Chris Anderson:
Hey, friends.
Look, government's chariot is coming.
Laxmi, I will give your notes tomorrow.
-Okay.
So many of them got down.
But did any girl look at us.
Oh! ls he a handsome prince?
Hey, look there.
Heaven's chariot is coming.

You didn't even look at his face.
Do you know how good he looks?
What is it?
Why don't you speak when I am talking to you?
You too like him, don't you?
No.
-Then why do you feel tensed whenever he comes to bus stop.
Leave it.
Am I not saying no?
- Then do something.
Tell him in person saying that you don't like him.. .. and don't come to see me.
Not that.. -Then?
I am afraid that I will start loving him if I see him.
Oh!
You will not love him but he should run behind you.
Selfish!
-Yes.
I am selfish.
I don't have father.
I have two younger sisters.
My mother has pinned all her hopes on me.
She is working very hard in educating me.
ln these situations..
Sorry, dear.
At least meet him and tell his lies.. ..saying that you don't like him.
Don't raise hopes in him with your silence.
You know how much he waited for you.. ...since three years of our college.
Tomorrow is the last day of our college.
Your looks are my life. "
He is looking at you.
- I am watching him since long time. " Oh, dear.
Look at me once. "
" I am waiting like moonlight. "
" Bring Diwali festival. "
" Oh, dear.
Why do you stay like a dream.. ..that is stuck between the eyelids? "
" Watch the eyes longing to see your beautiful eyes. "
" Eyes and heart belong to you. "
" I ran behind the time. "
Why doesn't she look at me? " Will I not stop breathing if she would.. "
" ..see me at least in my next birth? "
What happened?
She looked at my hand.
Did she see you?
" Everyday is a new day for me. "
" The feelings inside me say that. "
" You are watching me all the time. "
" This is a strange experience for me. "
" Your cool presence is granting me happiness.. "
" It doesn't matter I have to walk under the sun. "
" The heart is hiding its suffering in the name of love. "
" Let the moments spent in waiting for.. "
" ..you become my pleasant memories. "
" Let this continue even in coming births. " -Srinidhi!
His name is Krishna. - " Eyes and heart belong to you. "
Madam!
Don't you know before taking loan..
" I ran behind the time. - " ..that you should return it? " Will I not stop breathing if she would see me.. ..at least in my next birth? "
Brother..
Superb!
Hey, what are you doing here?

I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love..
I love you..
I love you..- How much you love us even in yours dreams.
I had that dream again.
Don't tell your stupid dream again.
Till now you have said it 1000 times.
Did you see his face at least today?
No. I couldn't see because of the light.
But you said I love you.
Even I don't understand that.
What do you think it is?
This is called mental in medical terms.
Maybe the person who appeared in your dream.. ..is Lord Tirupati Venkanna's third incarnation.
Are you joking?
- Not that..
You say that his face is glowing and all that..
That's why.
Asha, if that dream comes true then I will love only him.. ..irrespective of his looks and the place he lives in.
I will marry only him.
This is not original gun!
Stop it!
They are my friends.
Sorry, madam.
- Just go away.
Okay, madam.
- I am so sorry, Richard.
Really sorry.
- Superb.
Don't want your friendship.
- Come on.
Let us go.
This is the way to treat friends?

Excuse me.
According to lndian lntelligence report, ... this man is staying along with his gang here.. ..for the past six months.. - Father.. ..why are you torturing me like this?

Paid you money, but didn't get till now.
I've been noticed now.
All of us may get caught!
Why are you behaving like this in spite of.. ..knowing the threat against your father?
Threat is for him, so give the security to him.
Leave me alone.
What if terrorists kidnap you and blackmail your father?
You have to follow the protocol.
- You just shut up!
Okay?
Sravanthi, why are you talking like that without showing any respect?
Who do you think he is?
He is my chief security officer.
Oh!
He is more important than me.
It is not like that, Sravanthi.
Sir, why do you hurt her?
Sravanthi, who else do I have other than you?
Try to understand.
Should I alone understand every time, father?
Excuse me, sir.
Time to catch the flight.
Okay. I am going to US.
It will take 10 days to come back.
Be careful.

Hyderabad
What is it with your nephew?
He is into fights all the time.
He lands up in jail once in every two months.
This time your boy has beaten a minister's son.
It is very difficult to get bail.
Since you are a famous doctor I forgive me and release him.
Leave me!
Leave me!
- Stop, father!...
Please, brother!
- Leave me!
Leave me!
Listen to me, brother!- No, brother!
- No, brother!- Don't shoot him.
I cannot leave him like this.
I will shoot him!
I will shoot him!
- Leave it!
He is creating nuisance everyday.
I am losing my respect because of him.
They will come, brother!
Within five minutes everyone will come.
Did you find something, uncle?
Hey!
Where did you till now?
Me? I was in Ramesh's room.
Six families.
16 rooms.
Nobody is taking advantage ofjoint families as you do.
Your father has abused you badly.
Why do you give him tension?
Why don't you come on time?
Tell this to him, uncle.
Didn't I tell you that every useless fellow will give us.. ..advices if we roam around useless places at midnight?
Yes.
You said.
-Just miss.
Sister! I am coming.
What?
Will you come now?
- Didn't we come, sister?
What is this carnival for?
- Today I underwent scanning.
I am going to have a girl child.
That's why this party.
Oh!
Okay?
Will you not give party if it is a boy?
No!
What if the boy turns out to be like you?
I am so lucky.
Have you seen it?
It has been 22 years since we are born.
Ever did they throw any party?
She is not born yet and there is already a party.
Attack!
-Yes!
Brother, why did you take 2000 rupees from my box in morning?
What?
Today I saw your boy friend Raghu in the pub.
With a girl.
Brother, did you take the money or not?
Don't divert the topic.
Sukanya, she is beautiful than you.
That is my fear.
She is looking darn good in a short skit, isn't it?
She is superb!
ls there a tattoo on her shoulder?
I will teach him a lesson.
Don't you have shame for 2000?
You too found it?
- Yuck!
Okay.
Come.
Silence!
Silence!
Don't talk
Now father will speak.
Father, speak.
When I first came to Hyderabad.
Hey!
Stop!
What is that teasing?
Don't you have respect for elders?
Don't speak!
Father, you too don't speak.
I will speak.
Okay.
- One good news is that one more girl is going.. ..to take birth instead of a useless boy.- Father, I will..
Another good news is that our business.. ..turnover has crossed 50 crores.
There is another great news than this.
This gathering is held for disclosing the same.
This is not a gathering.
It is bothering.
Our partners from Paris have put forth a proposal.. ..asking us to open a branch there.
I said okay.
What is it?
They told us to send one person from.. ..us for studying the market.
That's why I have decided to select one from.. ..your generation rather than my generation.
They can take another person with them if they wish.
Nephew, give it.
- Take it.
Everybody's name is put in this except one.
Why didn't you put my name?
You came to know that your name is not in it even without being told.
So you must also know why we didn't put it.
So do something.
Give me in writing saying that I am not your son.
I will leave this house.
Oh!
Bring a stamp paper.
I will write it right now.
Wait, brother!
- Go!
Go!
What is all this?
Did you think that I will leave the house if you leave out my name?
I will send everyone present here to jail and then leave.
To jail?
Why?
What, aunt?
Don't you know that it is against the law to undergo scanning?
Brother, he might do it.
So what?
- lnclude his name too.
Revathi!
- Brother, I will be debarred from the medical council.
Okay.
You have achieved it.
- What did you think then?
Hey, take me too if your name comes.
I never saw Paris even in books.
You?
No chance.
Ram!
Yes. I know.
Thank you.
- Sit down.
Sit down.
Hey, Raghava!- Yes, brother!
- Ask whom he will take with him.
Hey! ls it me?
Uncle!
We are very close since childhood.
Who else will he take?
Nonsense!
There are so many people in the house.
Nobody knows where Sravanthi went.
So what are you all doing?
Sir, we have inquired with Sravanthi's friends.
They say they don't know anything.
I am not sure if they are telling the truth.
But if you say yes then we will file a complaint with.. ..the police and inquire at all airports and railway stations.
No.
No.
She was asking for freedom.
She must be somewhere around.
lf this matter gets leaked then it will be a problem for us.
Let us wait for some more time.
Hey, Ram!
How are you?
How is the journey?
It is going on since long time.
ls it?
- Give it to me.
Hey..
How is Paris?
-Who is it?
It is me.
Sukanya.
- ls that you, Sukku?
How badly you tortured me for mere 2000.
Do you know what my range is now?
White people carry my luggage and Benz car drives me around.
You are acting smart.
Come to lndia. I will see you.
Why did you become silent?
Hey!
Ramya.
It seems there is something burning around.
- Hey!
Give it!
Hey, Ram! -I didn't finish talking.
You would take me to all worst places.. ..when you were in Hyderabad.
But now will go alone to Paris.
I am feeling jealous here.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Don't feel jealous of few people in life.
Ranji in style, Sachin in cricket, Rahman in music..
And it is me from our house.
Aunt, he is giving punches to me.
Hey! ls it Ram?
Give it to me!
Hey, Ram!
How are you?- Tell him.. - Hey!
Go inside!- Tell me!
Tell me!
Luck is chasing me like a dog.
Excuse me, sir.
Passport please.
- Yes.
Thank you.
-Keep the change.
- Where were we?
-Dog.
Dog..
You know puppy?
- Puppy?
Hey, I like puppies a lot.
Bring 4, 5 puppies when you come.
Don't forget.- Hello.
By the way, why did you leave our Ramesh and go?- Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Dear, give the phone.
- Take it, brother-in-law.
Hey.. - Father?
Do you know where you are now?
ln front of wine factory.
Wine factory?
Father, I like wine.
Too much, father.
Turn back and see.
The car that brought you has left.
- Yes.
They must have taken your passport too.
- Yes.
Hey!
Listen to me carefully.
From today you are a coolie in that wine factory.
You have to earn your bread and butter by yourself.
Finally you only have to earn the expenses required.. ..to travel back to lndia.
It means you need to slog down like a donkey.
Then you will understand what life is.
It is difficult to escape from there.
It is not a palace. It is prison.
Father!
What is this, brother?
Not that only he knows the sketches and schemes.
I too know them. I am his father.
Will you steal money from me citing income tax?
Fights, police stations.. Yuck!
Yuck!
Yuck!
I gave him many chances but he didn't change.
That's why I made this plan.
He has fallen.
Brother..
Then what about the branch in Paris..
Chits..
It is my plan.
I wrote his name in all chits.
But you said you will send one person with him.
Who else will he take other than this rogue?
He has escaped.
Just miss.
Brother, you have committed a big mistake.
He doesn't have a mother.
He is taking advantage of this sentiment.
He should go through this.
His boss over there is not an ordinary person.
Very strict.
Disciplined.
lron man.
My friend.
Pulla Reddy.
Hey, Pandu.
Tell me why I am beating you.
I told you to crush grapes and make juice.
Will you eat 25 kilograms like a pig?
Don't beat me, sir!
- Will you eat like a pig?
Sir.. -Did you give some gap or ate everything together?
Sir, I was hungry and I didn't know it.
Did you feel hungry?
Eat me too!
Oh!
Oh! It is okay, sir.
There is lot of waste material in it.
Sir, he is the son of your friend Krishna Rao.. ..from Hyderabad.
Oh! ls that you?
You look innocent.
But they said you are a tough guy.
lf you wag your tail here, I will cut it.
Henceforth live on your earnings.
Otherwise spend your entire life here.
One bottle ofjuice is made by crushing.. ..25 kilograms of grapes.
One bottle fetches you 5 rupees.
lf you pay 5 rupees, you will get half bottle of water.
Sir, what is the ticket fare to Hyderabad?
- 45,000 rupees.- 45..
It means 9000 bottles.
Will I not go to Hyderabad if l don't crush 25,000 kilograms of grapes?
Hey, take him with you.
ls Pulla Reddy your father's friend?
ls he your father's friend too?
- Yes.
Friend of my father too.
So are they running this like a business?
No. lf the children of rich fathers' enjoy their father's status..
So are you rich?
- Yes.
How did you enjoy..
Everyone would call me Romeo Raja in Vizag.
Any girl would fall for me.
100 wickets went down.
My father couldn't tolerate it and..
Being so rich you have eaten 25 kilograms of grapes..
It is hitting somewhere.
lsn't it?
Good morning, madam Anusuya.
Coffee please.
- Why is he addressing the car as madam.. ...Anusuya and giving it coffee?
Pulla Reddy's mother Anusuya died suddenly in this car.
That 's why this car is sentiment for him.
ls it sentiment for dead people and punishment.. ..for people who are alive?
- Not only coffee..
Lunch in afternoon.. Dinner at night..
Alcohol too is offered on festivals.
Hey, friend.
New admission?
Come.
Come, friend.
Come.
What?
Did he say that he belongs to a rich family?
Don't believe it.
They are my sycophants.
My father booked tickets for them too saying enjoy Paris tour.
I got a doubt then.
But these rogues didn't believe me.
They suppressed my freedom like this by thinking.. ...of enjoying Paris tour for free.
Why did you stop?
We will get food only if we crush 60 bottles by evening.
Crush them!
Crush them!
Paris is taking my life.
Mister, this is not wine.
It is our blood.
Start music!
Swamy, our house has changed after he left the house.
You stop.
There is peace in the house after he left.
I worked hard and made this plan for sending him there.
He will not understand unless he works hard.
What, father?
Krishna...you think you have sent him.
Lot of strange incidents will take place in his life.
Everything for good.
Mother!
Where is my mother?
My goodness!
Why is the same factory seen?
What is this?
Suicide case?
Hey, you!
Are you talking to me?
- Then?
Are you really talking to me?
Yes. I am talking to you.
It seems she has become mad and thereby roaming around Paris.
Hey!
Mrs. Anasuya!
Mrs. Anasuya!
Oh!
Take him away?
- Hey!
What is this?
Mother!
Leave me!...
Did you try to escape?
Bring him!
What are you watching?
All this happened because of you.
Jump!
Jump!
Jump and die!
With whom is he talking?
You will die if you don't jump.
Hey!
With whom are you talking?
Where is she?
Hey!
You!
-Go!
What is it with him?
Has he gone mad?
Sir, mother is coming.
Hey!
Hey! I am sparing you because you are my friend's son.
Otherwise I would have drowned you in that.. ..river by putting you inside a bag.
- Sir..
Sir..
Sir..
Enough! I will leave Johnny at night.
Should I fear if you leave Johnny?
I will not fear Johnny or Tony.
Not just me, we all will escape this time.
What, Romeo?
No chance.
Who you do think Johnny is.
ls it a dog?
- No.
Tiger.- Tiger?
Sir..
Sir..
Sir..
Save me, sir.
Sir, it is me.
You have seen me in the morning.
You? It was good that I saw you in the morning.
Otherwise I would have thought you are a devil.
Sir, are you afraid of devil?
Deadly!
Well, what are you doing here?
Sir, four goons are chasing me.
I escaped them and reached.
And you are present here.
What is your fate, sir?
Why?
What happened to my fate?
What, sir?
Why do you say that?
When I saw you in the morning I thought what a handsome guy.
Those eyes..
Style..
Personality..
I was totally impressed.
When I saw you for the first time, I too felt the same.
But I don't talk rubbish like this.
Continue.. I mean you got impressed..
Yes, I was totally impressed.
But I couldn't tolerate when those rowdies.. ..were dragging you away like a dog.
31 10
And over here you seem to be living in jail..- Hey, father!
What, sir?
Why do you address father like that without showing any respect?
Then what? ls he a human being?
I am college topper in my city.
I couldn't study properly due to the T-20 matches in last semester.
I told him frankly that I will get second rank and you have to adjust with it.
But that person didn't show any mercy and.. ..thereby sent me here like a coolie.
Sir, is it necessary to come this far for working as coolie?
I will escape from there.
He said Paris.
I slipped over there and fell down here.
Don't feel bad anymore.
What is your story?
I told very fast.
You too say like that.
Start.
My name is Sravanthi.
I am from Nellor.
I am studying medicine final year.
I met a friend by name Janvu on Facebook.
He looks very handsome.
I fell for him watching his profile picture.
He would send me funny jokes daily.
As the days passed by, our friendship turned into love.
Oh!
There is lot of romance behind her.
He said..
Come to Paris, we will get married.
I came.
But..
Did he have fun with you?
Sir?- Then why are you crying?
Janvu.. - Janvu..
Janvu is a 40 year old man.
Then profile picture?
- Graphic.
Janvu..
Silly girl.
What can I do, sir?
I too slipped like you when I heard Paris.
Hey!
What?
Are you making fun?
ls it okay if you make fun of me?
Tell me.
-Janvu's age and money are more.
He has sent rowdies when I escaped from him.
I will stay here for one night.
Please!
What is that sound, sir?
Tiger.
-Tiger?
Yes.
Will you see?
Come.
What a silly boy?- Hey!
Sir, it is not an original tiger.
You know blue rays?
German technology.
Through the blue rays they create a high definition image.. ..that makes the image look realistic.
So.. - It is not a tiger.
That is.. - Blue ray.
Which is.. - German technology.
Yes.
Good boy.
Where is she?
Not an original tiger?
How do you know?
You know blue ray?
You?
You?- No.
Bloody illiterates.
Blue ray, It is a German technology..
It is not a tiger.
It is a blue ray.
Whatever it is, I am escaping this night.
lf anybody from you wants freedom, come with me.
What is that discussion?
Will you stop it and work?
Or should I increase the size of drums?
Crush it!
Will you scare me using useless technology and create tiger?
I will see you.
Mister, I too.. Hey, come.
Come.
Fast.
Tiger!
It is a real tiger!
Yes!
Come!
Come!
-Tiger!
You said that it is some effect.
Run!
Tiger!
Oh, my god!
Hey!
- Run!
Tiger is coming!
Tiger!
-Raja!
Come!
Run!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Get up!
Hey, don't you wish to live?
I will shoot all of you.
Sir, he said it is not a tiger.
It is a blue film.
It is not blue film. It is blue ray.
-Shut up!
Are you the reason behind this?
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Save me, sir.
Today also.. Four of them, sir..
You are right, sir.
They are chasing me.
Janvu gang, sir.
Sir, they have started the projection again.
German Technology.
My boy..
Come on..
Come on..
I will hit you!
Get out!
First get out!
Sir.. -What sir?
German technology..
Blue ray..
You have caught me like an ill-fate.
I am facing continuous problems from the time I met you.
Sir.. -I will kill you.. I will kill you..
Sir.. -I will kill you!
Go out! I say get out!
'My goodness!
She doesn't know it is a real tiger.'
'She will die if she goes near it thinking it to be blue ray.'
Where did she go?
What Johnny?
Why do you look so dull?
Sir, that fat guy fell on stomach.
Stomach is paining.
Okay.
Okay.
Drink one peg.
Enough!
Enough!
Go and do the work.
Come out. I will tell you.
Next?
What is this?
He is having a discussion instead of getting scared.
I will jump.- Tell me.
- What will I tell?
My goodness!
He removed it!
Did I run so far by getting scared of you?
One!
Two!
Three!
Now enough!
This tiger is injured from top to bottom.
Spare me, brother.
So do something.
Go and bring my passport.
Oh, yes.
Oh!
No!
Pulla Reddy has hidden it inside the locker.
So wait. I will tell this matter to everyone.
Brother! lf Pulla Reddy comes to know then he will kill me..
He is doing great business in this area because of me.
I don't know what and how you are going to do.
First let me escape from here.
I will take care of the rest.
Deal is okay.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
My bag!
This is more for you.
Go away!
'I say get out!'
I shouted unnecessarily.
Hi!
-Hi!
-What?
Jumped again?
Hey, who is that elder person?
Who?
Him?
Janvu.
Janvu.. - I have decided to marry him.
Why do you say that you will marry him?
70 year old man.
Will he look like Mahesh Babu?
Fate! I will adjust.
I will not adjust even if you adjust.
Hey, what are you and your beauty?
What is it with that old man?
Didn't you say that I am ill-luck?
Bad time.
Anyways, I cannot go to lndia.
I will become Mrs. Janvu in the next two days.
Janvu!
Janvu!
Janvu!
Janvu!
I feel irritated with the name.
What do you want?
You want to go to lndia, isn't it?
Leave it to me. I will take care.
You will say like that now.
After that you will scold.
Oh! I will not scold.
Promise. I will not scold.
Okay.
Then one condition.
You shouldn't take advantage and touch me.. ..since I am depending on you.
You shouldn't tell me any work.
I will not touch you even by mistake.
You say that you will not do any work.
What does it mean?
I will sweat if I do work.
And I hate sweat.
Not only her beauty but her pride too is big.
Have you seen it?...
You are thinking immediately.
It is nothing. I am thinking how to take you to lndia.
o you don't have passport.
Then how will you take me.
Okay.
Do as I say.
Don't ask why and what.
Okay?
How, DK?
For one week she left the house in the morning and returned by evening.
Now she is not coming home at all.
I don't understand what I should do.
You don't worry, sir.
We will find where madam Sravanthi is.
Yes.
Sir, there is someone here who says he is.. ..your friend's son from Hyderabad.
Yes.
Yes.
Send him in.
Good morning, sir.
- Are you Sharat's son?
Mr. Sharat is his close friend.
Poor man.
He died six months back.
So he will become bit emotional after seeing you.
I didn't think that Sharat will die suddenly like this.
I couldn't come.
Don't over react.
Well, how many siblings are you?
I am alone.
- Correct.
It was when you were born that I saw Sharat for the last time.
By the way, what for you came to Paris?
Uncle, I came on Europe tour with my friends.
Someone has stolen my bag two days back.
My passport was in it.
I was thinking what to do and I remembered you.
When you ask for passport, he will get a doubt.
Well, what is the guarantee that you are Sharat's son?
You tell him without holding any fear,
Uncle, he would always say that you passed.. ..intermediate exams by copying from his paper.
After that in college, you were involved with a girl..
Okay.
Okay.
Well, where are you staying?
-Hotel.
Why don't you come to my house?
You will get caught if you go to house.
No, uncle. I will stay with friends.
lf you look into passport's matter immediately..
Give your photo and details to my secretary outside.
Come and collect your passport day after tomorrow at 3 o'clock.
lf you face any problem before that then show this card.
Okay, uncle.
Your daughter, uncle?
Hey!- Bye, uncle.
How did you say it so correctly?
Who is he?
How do you know him?
Why didn't you come?
Had you come then it would have happened easily.
Didn't I say not to ask what and why?
He is Janvu's friend.
I can tell you till there.
I will get the passport.
That is okay.
But for going to lndia.. - I will tell you that later.
Two more days are left for getting the passport.
We have to earn money if we have to survive till then.
How?
But how?
Do as I say.
lf you do then you will get money.
Sir, I don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.
Sir, I don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.
Hey, Ram.
Look over there.
Go there and do it.
Excuse me, madam.
- What?
Sir, I don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, I don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.- Okay.
Hey!
What are you doing?
- Sir, movie aside!
Stop!
Stop!
-Stop!
Look!
No.
-Sir!
- He is dead!
Wonderful!
Superb idea.
Do this on road.
Put money.
'I will sweat if I do work.
And I hate sweat.'
Boss, who is that girl?
That girl?
Daughter of lndian ambassador.
What?
Why are you silent?
Which place you said that you belong to?
Nellore?
Yes.
Nellore.- Nellore.
Janvu.- Yes.
Janvu!
- Janvu!
What happened to Janvu now?
- Nothing has happened to him.
But you would have married him and settled down if he was bit young.
But he is old and so you left him.
What?
Why are you talking differently?
Sravanthi, if your love was true then marry Janvu.
Come.
- Where?
To Janvu.
Come!
Don't come closer to me.
I will not come.
Then you too don't come chasing me.
Good bye.
Don't go by leaving me.
Please, Ram!- Bye!
Help!
Help me.
Help!...
Why did you come again?
Oh!
You didn't feel like going by leaving me.
You have misunderstood me.
I really loved him.
But he is not a good person.
I will thrash you!
How do I look?
Do you think I am mad?
I came to know everything.
You are ambassador's daughter.
lf you say Janvu and rubbish then I will strangle you.
Fraud!
Fraud!
- Who is fraud?
You couldn't survive in the factory forjust two days.
But I lived like a prisoner for ten years.
Everywhere I went, there was security.
My friends too left me.
I had been through torture.
That's why I wanted to live my own life. ls it a mistake?
I was afraid to go to lndia alone.
And then I met you.
I have a close friend by name Savita in Hyderabad.
She is a doctor in Gandhi hospital.
I too studied medicine.
I decided to settle down there with her help.
lf I escape for another two days from my father's men.. ..then I will have freedom all my life.
Please help me.
Help? I will do.
But I want 10,000 Euros.
What?
Are you joking?
Where do I have so much of money?
But you said that you will give money for flight tickets.. ..when I asked you.
From did you think of bringing it then?
Ram, it is very risky.
We shouldn't use that idea expect at the last minute.
Otherwise we will get caught.
Not we will get caught.
You will get caught!
The work on which I came to Paris should be completed.
Otherwise I will directly go to your father and meet him.
Not for my passport but to book you permanently.
What do you say?
Deal or no deal?
'Go to the main building in the university campus.'
'After you enter inside.. ..go to first floor by taking the staircase on the right.'
'There are many statues in the hall.'
'The third one belongs to Albert Richardson.'
'My locker's key lies behind it.'
'Locker number is 1133.'
'My ATM cards are inside a brown pouch lying in it.'
Where is Sravanthi?
-It is.. I am Sravanthi's friend.
Please tell her to go to her house.
Tell her to call at least her father.
Police is torturing us.
- Okay.
Father!
Father!
Father!
-Hey, son.
How are you?
Father, my life should become a lesson to everyone.
I want to tell lot of things if you can call everyone.
I will definitely call, dear.
Here..
Ramya!
Ramesh!
Sukanya!
Gopi!
Everyone come here.
Father, has everyone come?
Now turn the speaker on.
Okay.
Okay.
I did.
Now tell.
Now pour out your entire grief!
Cry as much as you can.
After that you will not have money to make any call.
Forgive me, father.
Now I have understood what life is.
Did you think that I will say like this, Mr. Father?
What, father?
Will you teach me what life is?
Don't try comedy, father.
Hey!
Do you know with whom you are talking to?
Who is this?
Oh!
The one who drinks local liquor in imported glass.
ls it uncle Raghav?
Ram, what are you talking?
Aunt..
Tell me, dear.- Aunt.. - Tell me, dear.
Aunt!- Hey, tell me!
You too joined hands with them and did this to me.
Was my mother doing this to me if she was alive?
Hey, I too didn't know until you left.
Listen to me.
Have patience for few days and.. ..then come back as your father said.
What, aunt?
Are you playing with me?
Look, Mr. Pattapagalu Krishna Rao.
For making my life dark..
For torturing an lndian citizen like this..
lPC section 8, 10, 15, 20..
I will put you behind bars under some section..
I am..
Not yours.. " There is a kick felt inside the body. "
" The entire body is shaking. "
How big is the TVtower? " Why is it standing in my way?
What is its pride? "
" You are in Paris now. "
" This TVtower is the Eiffel tower. " So what is the great thing about it? "
" Nobody is greater than me. "
" Henceforth I am the owner. "
" I will give it my name. " You are not the Tippu Sultan of olden days. " It is better if you stop your bubble like talks. " Oh, TVtower.
You are very tall. "
" Henceforth you and I will bear the same name. "
" Everything is class.
Everything is posh. "
" Money is there. "
" Oh, yes. " " But still the dress is very small.
What to do? "
" Paris is like that. "
" It is like this all around. "
" This place is synonymous with fashion. "
" This place is world famous. "
" Let it be anything.
But is it necessary to do all this. "
" Why don't you teach our headgear and.. ...loin cloth outfit to these people? "
" Oh, is he is a boy or girl? " He is wearing a pony tail.
He is a queer. "
" It is disgusting in the name of fashion. " Everybody is confusing. "
" What is this romance and crazy nuisance in public? "
" There is no secrecy.
Everything is out in the open. "
" It is called crime.
Don't watch like that. "
" These kinds of scenes are very common here. "
" Have they used superglue instead of lipstick? "
" Have they locked themselves in kisses by missing out on life? "
" Oh, my god.
You behave as if you don't know French kiss. "
" You don't talk with sarcasm like that. "
" I am telling you the truth.
I swear on you. "
" I don't posses any talent in kissing. "
So didn't we go around Paris?
Finished!
Everything is finished!
You were sleeping for 18 hours.
I tried a lot to wake you up.
But you didn't wake up.
He told you to come at 3 O'clock for collecting the passport.
Now the time is 4 o'clock.
Embassy too will be closed in another hour.
Flight is at 8 o'clock.
I don't think we can make it.
- But I am sure we will.
Ram, I will come to the airport directly.
You collect the passport and wait for me.
lf I am not seen then it means that the security has caught me.
Don't wait for me.
You go.
Bye, Ram.
- It will not happen like that.
We both are going to lndia together.
That's it.
It should be circulated *immediately.
- Okay, sir.
Hello, uncle.
- Yes.
Didn't I say my friend's son?
It is him- Hello.
Find out from David whether the passport is ready or not.
Sure, sir.
Hello, Subbu.
- David, come in.
What?
Are you sure?
Darn it!
- What happened, sir?
Money has been withdrawn from Sravanthi's account.
So she is here.
What are you searching?
Sir, will you please give the phone?
Hello.
DK here.
lf the money is withdrawn from ATM then everything.. ..will be recorded in security camera.
Send the video footage immediately to the embassy's email.
We will know within five minutes who has withdrawn it.
Why will others do it?
Sravanthi will only do it.
Uncle, if you give my passport immediately..
Hey..
What are you we doing here?
Wait!
Son, we are worried about something.
Come and collect the passport tomorrow.
It is not that, uncle.
It is urgent..- Get out I say!
I said get out!
Excuse me, sir.
Passport is ready.
- Oh, that's good.
Okay, you can go.
- Thanks, sir.
He has hidden his face from camera.
DK, I find both the reasons that you said are wrong.
He is not her friend.
He is not a thief.- Then sir?
I think she is in love with this boy.
All my doubts have come true in Sravanthi'a matter since her childhood.
'lf I am not seen then it means that the security has caught me.'
'Don't wait for me.
You go.'
Ram!
Hey!
- Don't talk anything.
Come to the Gandhi hospital directly.
Dr. Savitha.
Don't forget.
Hey!
Sravanthi!
Excuse me..
Dr. Savitha..
She is in lCU on first floor.
- Thanks.
Yes.
Whom do you want?
Dr. Savitha.. - Yes.
Tell me.
I am Sravanthi's friend.
Sravanthi?
Who is Sravanthi?
Sravanthi who lives in Paris..
Medical student..
Your friend.
Sorry. I don't know any Sravanthi.
I think you are mistaken.
By the way, this is lCU.
You shouldn't enter inside.
Please wait outside.
You are dr.
Savitha, isn't it?
-Yes.
No.
Sravanthi told me about you.
You too have..
Didn't I tell you to go out..
What happened to Sravanthi, doctor?
Do you know this girl?
ls her name Sravanthi?
She was with me at the airport just half an hour back..
What happened to her, doctor?
Accident case.
We have admitted her one week back.
She is lying in coma since then.
We are worried because we don't know who she is.
Admitted one week back?
You stay here. I will talk to my superintendent.
Sir, we have admitted a coma patient last week.
Her acquaintance has come.
Thank god!
Nothing happened to you, right?
Have you seen this girl?
She looks exactly like you.
I have brought you so far for showing you this.
Your sister?
What happened, Sravanthi?
I too was excited like you to enjoy life.
But because of my father's position.. ..l have grown up in the midst of tight security.
His position and status has robbed me of my freedom.
Two weeks back my father went to America on conference work.
I took advantage of it and escaped from the.. ..house alone with the help of uncle Madhav.
I would go out and enjoy a lot with friends.
One day my car gave some trouble and.. ...l was waiting at a restaurant.
Over there I saw DK who was supposed to be with my father.
I got suspicious and thereby followed him.
I was shocked to see DK meeting the.. ..most wanted terrorist wanted by lndian government.
DK saw me and chased me to kill me.
I tried a lot to tell this matter to my father.
But I couldn't reach his number.
Oh!
No!
Hello.
Excuse me.
- Any problem?
Please..
He is trying to kill me.
Save me please.
What is your problem?
Hey, man!
Are you safe?
Don't call anybody because the entire.. ..network is in his control.
lf you tell this matter to your father.. ..then he too will not believe it.
DK is suspicious with me.
Now I too will get caught for sending you out.
Tell me where you are.
I will come there.
Madhav uncle felt that it is not safe for me to stay in Paris.
He made arrangements for sending me to lndia.
Here is the duplicate passport.
Name is Kalpana.
There is no option left to save you, dear.
There is a flight to Hyderabad after one hour.
My friend Sitaram will pick you after you get down there.
You talk to me from his phone.
Till then don't talk to your father or anybody.
You will be caught by DK.
ln case if you face any problem with immigration.. ...then our men are present there.
They will take care.
Hey, Koka.- Greetings, sir.
What are you doing here?
- My cousin is coming from abroad.
It is not more than a week since you got released from jail.
Have you started a new business immediately?
Whom are you planning to dupe this time.
Microsoft?
When did you join there?
Did you get recruited from jail?
I understood that the person sent my uncle Madhav is a criminal.
I escaped from them.
Otherwise you will get thrashed again.
Rogue!
He came at the right time.
Hey, Giri!
Are you ready?
Brother, she is dead.
There shouldn't be any evidence of hers.
Check it.- Okay, brother.
How can you say it with guarantee that she is dead?
Brother, if the person bleeds from ear then they are dead.
No! I didn't die!
Who are you?
Why did you do this to me?
Brother..
Patrolling.
Sir..
Sir..
Sir, she is dead.
lnform the station.
They have confirmed that the driver and I have died.
They have sent our bodies to mortuary.
I am alive.
Please, listen to me.
Doctor!
Doctor, please help me.
Please help me.
I am alive, doctor.
Listen to me, doctor!
Please!
Tell them not to take me.
- What happened, Giri?
Madam, she died on the spot.
Accident case.
Anyways you don't give respect to people who are alive.
At least give respect to the people who are dead.
Oh!
My god!
Her pulse is beating.
Shift her to the lCU immediately.
ln this matter Dr. Savitha shifted me to lCU.. ..and started the treatment.
I tried a lot to tell this matter to my father.
But he didn't listen to me.
We have inquired all friends of Sravanthi.
Everyone is saying they don't know anything.
Father, don't believe him.
He is lying.
She wanted freedom all the time.
She must be somewhere around.
lf others come to know this matter then it will be a problem to us.
Let us wait for some more time.
- No!
No!
Father! I am here!
lf you had acted in haste and have killed her here.. ..then we would have been caught easily.
Now we made him say by himself that.. ..she left in the name of freedom.
Though I knew that DK and uncle Madhav.. ..were behind this, I couldn't tell this to anyone.
I understood that I am going to die like.. ..an orphan in an lndian hospital.
I lost all hopes.
But you called me and that gave me a new lease of life.
There are billions of people in this world.
It was only you who saw me.
Also you were the only person who talked to me.
I thought of telling you everything that time.
But what if you didn't believe.
I was afraid that I will lose the only hope that I had.
That's why I brought you so far.
I thought of telling you the truth only after showing you me.
Till then I remained careful so that you.. ..wouldn't come to know about me.
That is me.
lsn't it strange?
There are so many people in this world.
How is it that only I am able to see you?
How come I alone hear your words?
Even I am not able to understand it.
What do you think the reason is?
'Why didn't I see you?'
'I want to see you.'
'I want to see you!'
So you know who that girl is.
I know.
She is my friend.
- Her father..
It is good not to tell them anything until father arrives.
I know.
-Tell me if you know.
Mr. Jayasuriya.
What does he do?
- I don't know, sir.
Her mother?
- Mrs. Jayasheela.
Oh!
What does she do?
She married Mr. Jayasuriya.
- Okay.
Sir, I don't know what she did after that.
Am I talking correctly?
- Correct, sir.
Do you know where they are?
- ln Africa.
Where in Africa? -I don't know, sir.
Africa is not a village or a country.
It is a continent.
There are 56 countries in it.
Population is 100, 03, 65, 690.
They are...
Superb, sir!
Today I learnt a lot of information from you.
But I am not getting anything from you.
- Sir, I have an idea.
How about giving an ad in the entire Africa.
You and I should sell everything that belongs to us.
Don't give suggestions for fun.
- Now you may go.- Okay.
lf you remember something then come and tell me.- Okay, sir.
Pen is mine.
- Okay, sir.
What?
Why did you confuse him like that?
Why? I was in confusion and in addition to that..
Well, you are a devil..
lf one dies then only they are called devil.- She is still alive.
Then spirit.. I mean soul..
Consider it anything.
First talk slowly.
Why?
-Everyone is watching you.
Everyone is thinking me as mad, isn't it?
Ram, I should call up my father and tell him everything.
Hail!
-Farmers employee!
Rajanna!...
The present force is not sufficient, sir.
Send additional force.
Please.
Okay.
Excuse me, sir.
-Yes.
- What is the matter?
Doctors said that their leader will die if he undergoes fast.
That's why we are giving him treatment after arresting him.
This sloganeering is for the same.
Hey!
Don't allow inside.
Hey!
Hey!
-We have to see Rajanna!
Boss, I have to make a call to Paris.
- Do it.
Don't take it easy.
I am very serious about the decision.
Sir, listen to me carefully.
Don't ask who I am.
I know you are searching for your daughter.
She is lying here in a government hospital in Hyderabad.
Your chief security officer DK is responsible for all this.
He has got links with the terrorists' organizations.
He tried to kill your daughter too when he came.. ..to know that your daughter is aware of it.- Sir, you come fast.
We will be waiting here in the government hospital.
She badly needs your help.
Who is it, DK?
Anything important?
Wrong number, sir.
With your permission I will change this number for security reasons.
It is DK.
What are you doing there?
Sir, a small love story is at the climax.
Small settlement.
Tell me.
Why did you spare that girl without killing her?
Hey!
Come.
What are you talking, sir?
She died on the spot.
Her body is lying in the Gandhi hospital mortuary.
Hey, fool!
Not in the mortuary.
It is in lCU.
Someone has called up.
Go and find out those two people.
lf she is alive then my life will fall in danger.
..l had given you lot of trouble.
For how long will you stay here?
Anyways my father is coming.
He will now take care.
You go.
Oh!
Your father is coming, right?
What?
Why are you talking in a strange manner?
Nothing.
You said Janvu is your love.
And that is one lie.
You said you had fallen for me when.. ..you saw me for the first time.
That too is a lie.
Similarly our meeting too is going to become a lie.
Right?
Sravanthi..
Oxygen..
Hey!
Hey!
Who are you?
Doctor!
Connect a fresh cylinder.
lncrease the pressure.
Quick!
Hello.
You were outside.
How did you know that the oxygen is finished?
It is..
What?
I felt something like that.
Therefore I came.
So if something happens there then the reaction will be felt here.
It is good for me to stay here till your father comes.
Hey, stop!
Where is your pass?
Go!
For how long will you sit like this?
Go downstairs and eat something.
Please.
Ram!
What?- The person who tried to kill me is going towards lCU.
Ram, it is him.
So we didn't talk to your father.
Hey, I am Shiva.
Take 10,000 and come to Gandhi hospital urgently.
We should get uncle discharged.
Why?
Some person by name Rajanna has died here.
We will take uncle before the matter gets leaked.
Rajanna is dead!
It we stay here then it is dangerous all the time.
We have to shift urgently.
Please give me two days time, DK.
Take it.
Take three days.
lf the work is not done then you will not stay alive.
DK, I am afraid that we will get caught.
One shouldn't live in fear.
It is more fearsome.
Madam, Ram has come.
- Did Ram come?
He has brought a patient.
He is saying to admit her.
Okay.
Admit her.
I am coming immediately.
Do you think I am mad to believe everything you say?
Soul?
Body is here and soul is there?
Aunt, it is there.
- Hey, don't act stupid.
I don't know how I should make you believe.
Aunt, you go there.
Sravanthi, you go there.
Ram.- Come, aunt.
- What are you doing?- I will tell you.
You go.
What?- Keep your hands behind.
Keep your hands behind.
Show me some number with your hands.
Tell me.
-Two.
-Two.
Five.
-Five.
Three.
-Three.
One.
-One.
Two.
-Two.
Two... -Two...
She is not changing.
She is showing the same two fingers.
Two..
Two..
Two..
For how long will you show two fingers?
Aunt, will you at least now believe me?
Swamy, how come a person's soul leaves the body when they are alive?
How come only my nephew is able to see it?
I don't believe this.
Why is it happening like this?
There are many things in this world that are.. ..beyond science and technology's reach.
Some religions believe that the soul comes out.. ..even when the person is alive.
So Hindu religion believes that the soul leaves the body.. ..only when the person dies.
There is a strong reason behind all these happenings.
You will not believe it even if I say it now.
Whatever has to happen, will happen.
You do whatever is possible with you.
Okay, Swamy.
- Greetings.
What is the reason, Swamy?
Every human being takes birth seven times.
Their love is becoming unsuccessful since six births.
Now this is the last birth.
Love is longing to become successful at least now.
Very sad.
Will their love succeed at least in this birth, Swamy?
This is a fight between destiny and love.
Destiny will win in this fight.
Destiny will win.
Swamy, pray for their love's victory.
Oh, god!
What, aunt?
Why don't you speak?
She will not speak anything now.
My condition is like that.
There is a blood clotting inside the brain.
It should be melt.
Very critical.
It is difficult to survive.
That's why she is afraid to tell you.
Why are you watching like that?
I am too a medical student.
I am telling this only after checking the reports.
Aunt, is there a blood clotting inside her brain?
Hey, how do you know?
ls it difficult for her to survive?
No, dear.
There are chances of survival.
Recently a medicine has been invented in German.
That medicine should be injected into the brain through blood vessels.
lf three doses are given in an interval of 48 hours then.. ..there are chances of that clot getting melt.
Then the patient might come out of coma.
But there is a risk involved in it.
Risk?
What risk, aunt?
lf we begin these doses then the next two doses.. ..should be given on time.
lf there is any delay then the heart will.. ..stop beating and the patient might die.
It has already happened with a patient.
After giving the first dose there was a delay in giving the next dose.
Finally he died.
I am afraid of the same.
The two doses brought for that patient are here.
We have to bring the third dose from Germany.
Main problem is that if we start the treatment immediately.. ..then the patient might survive.
Then start is immediately, aunt.
- We can start.
lf we start it without informing her family then.. ..you will face problem later.
Aunt, you start it.
Let there be any problem, I will face it.
Yes.
- What happened, aunt?
I will make this girl stand in another four days.
Superb, aunt.
Thank you, aunt!
Thank you, aunt!- Okay.
Love you!
Love you!
Love you!
- Enough!
Leave me!
Hey!
Why are you watching like that?
Fall at aunt's feet and seek her blessings.
God bless you, dear.
God bless you, dear.
Aunt..
She didn't fall yet.
Didn't fall yet?
Everything good will happen to you.
You will definitely live, dear.
Ram, I want to see your family.
Aunt, shall we go home?
Had I found you during that time then I would have killed.
Want to come home?
Want to come home?
Where?
Where is the girl?
Look, dear.
Both of you keep talking and stay here.
Hey, if you have any plans of coming home then you better forget them.
Let us go fast.
Come.
Come.
Come.
Come.
Come.
Hey!
Who are you?- Come on.
- Why are you entering the house directly?
ls it Mr. Pattapagalu Krishna Rao's house?
- Yes.
So we came to the right house.
Come.
Let us go inside.
- Hey, stop.
Who are you?- Media.
The state government has announced the best industrialist award to you.
Your feelings?
-Stop!
Stop!
That award..
Krishna Rao.. He is inside.
lnside?
Come on.
Come inside.
What if you are from media?
Will you trample me?
Come.
Come.
Good morning, Krishna Rao.
Hey, who are you?
Media.
Government has given the best industrialist award to you.
You eat.
Don't stop.
Sir, how many dumplings you eat every day?
What is the advice that you want to give to the industrialists of the state.
Excuse me.
Let us sit in the garden and talk.
Come.
Now tell me.
What is the name of the award?
lndustrialist..
Pundit of business..
Beloved entrepreneur.. Acute and leading pioneer..
It doesn't look like an award.
It looks like a letter of appreciation.
It is a very prestigious award.
That's why it is so big.
By the way, how are you feeling on receiving this award?
Should I tell?
Father, they have asked for brother's feelings.
They may feel something else if you tell your feelings.
Truly speaking I feel surprised.
- We are shocked.
He heard it.
Though I feel surprised for being chosen for this award.. ..in spite of having so many industrialist in our state..
I also feel happy.
Who do you think is behind your success?
We have to find the same.
lsn't it, brother?
There is nobody in front and behind me.
It is just my handwork.
How many children do you have?
One daughter and only one son.
Revathi, why do you talk about him now?
Sir, where is your son now?
- He is in Paris.
He should take care of the business after brother.
That's why my brother has sent him to Paris.
lsn't it, brother?
- Are you missing him?
Which father wouldn't miss his son?
- Superb, father!
Congratulations, father!
Today everyone has come to know that you are not.. ..only a good father but also a good businessman.
I am proud of you, father.
I am proud of you.
Hey!
Hey!
Go inside and freshen up.
Hey, Revathi!
-Brother..
Media.
Okay..
Go.
- Father, should I enter the house?
Are you sure, father?
- Yes..
Sure.
You go.
Okay.
One second.
Close up.
Smile, father.
Hey, you are a big thief.
- Yeah.
Hey, uncle?
What's up?
Your time is good and because of the media.. ..your father allowed you inside.
That's why you just missed.
I have sent it.
Just twist.
Hey, is this your sketch?
Wait. I will tell your father.
Uncle.
-What?
lf you tell about the sketch then who will drink the scotch lying in my bag.
I will.
Anything serious, sir?
- My daughter is in Hyderabad.
How do you say that, sir?
The other day a person took the passport.. ..saying he is the son of my friend.
He is not my friend's son.
It is not just that, DK.
Only my daughter knows how close I was with my friend.
How did he come to know about it?
So she has guided him and has sent him to me for passport.
He left for the Hyderabad on the same day he took the passport.
But Sravanthi left for Hyderabad five days.. ..before using a different name.
I have received a call now.
Don't know why.. I am afraid to tell this matter outside.
I should know where my daughter is.
And how she is.- Sir.
What are you saying?
ls that award a drama played by him?
Yes, father.
Chanti told everything last night under the influence of alcohol.
Me? I thought not to tell.
Did I tell?
Just miss.
Father, look at those steps.
Poor guy.
He is still under the impression.
His gait too has changed like NTR's from the movie Kondaveeti Simham.
It seems he will come to know of it because of your fun.
Poor brother.
Let us tell the truth to brother, father.
Think well.
Brother is already suffering from a weak heart.
No.
No.
Brother should never come to know the truth.
Savitri, had you been alive then you would have felt very happy.
The name of the award is.. Hey, what is the name of the award?
Great lndustrialist.. Pundit of business..
Beloved entrepreneur.. Acute and leading pioneer..
I have received such a big award.
But you are not there.
Don't feel sad, brother.
Satellites are present in the sky.
Sister-in-law must know it before us.
Just miss.
Revathi.- Brother.
- Last night I watched TV and I even read.. ..today's newspapers.
My news is not found anywhere.
This is not an ordinary award.
It is a prestigious award.
They will check the TRP ratings and announce it.. ..either on Sankranthi or Deepavali festival.
Correct.
- We can burn crackers after watching it.
Just miss.
Uncle, father is not giving me 10,000 when I asked him.
I will tell him.
Chinna.
- Brother.
Don't give him even ten paisa.
Are you happy?
- What is it uncle?
I have invited all my friends for party... ...because you have won a great award.
Now watch how insulting it will be.
Hey!
Hey!
Ramesh, is it award party?
lf he doesn't give you then I will give you.
Take it.
- Brother, it is..
Enjoy.. - Brother, think with your heart.
Enjoy..
Hey..
Savitri..
Uncle.. - Who?
lndustrialist.. Pundit of business..
Beloved entrepreneur.. Acute and leading pioneer..
Hail!
Pattapagalu Krishna Rao!
Though he is a kid, how well he said.
Uncle, I told my friends that I will give them pizza party.
At least 5,000.. - You gave birth to a good boy.
Enjoy coke with pizza.
- Hail!
Pattapagalu Krishna Rao!...
We can buy the award in real with these expenses.
Then why did you give up.
Sister, I tried a lot to memorize this award.
I am unable to even pronounce it.
How happily he is sleeping after torturing such a good family.
Hey, friend! It is me.
Tell me.
-Results are out.
Our entire batch is out.
None of them has passed even in one subject.
Wow!
What a good news, dear?
Am I college first?
- Ram!
And you?
- Hey, what first?
I should beat myself with footwear for copying.. ..from your chits instead of my chits.
Party?
No.
No.
lf needed then I will distribute books to poor children.. ..but I will not spend money for such useless parties.
You know it.
Hey, Balu. I am telling something and he is replying something else.
So there must be some girl by his side.- Oh, I see.
Dear, poor people over here say that they don't want books.
They want full.
Should I order from Amar wines in your name?
Hey!
Hey!
Why are you in a hurry?
I will come to college.
Even if you say that you will come, they will not allow you.
They have debarred you.
We will be allowed to enter the college until we bring our father.
That is principal's order.
What happened, Ram?
What?
- Uncle is calling.
Why?- There is a phone call from college.
So quickly?
ls everyone downstairs?
- Everyone is present.
How happy you look.
Wow!
What a beautiful moment?
Go. I am coming.
- Okay.
Sravanthi, you have to promise me something.
What?
- It is nothing.
You shouldn't come downstairs in the next one hour.- Why?
Didn't my father send me to Paris as punishment.. ..because I would be getting second rank?- Yes.
Now he will feel bad after knowing that I got first rank.
He will feel shy.
He will become emotional.
He will burst..
Sravanthi, it will be difficult to control him.
lf you watch my father like that, I may..
Okay.
Okay. I can understand.
You go. I will not come.
Hey, you shouldn't come.
I will not come.
This is your moment.
Go ahead.
Uncle, he is coming.
Come, dear.
Come.
Did you wake up?
You studied very well without passing even in one subject.
How did I allow you to enter the house?
Brother.. lndustrialist.. Pundit of business..
Beloved entrepreneur.. Acute and leading pioneer..
I spare you because I agreed in front of the media.. ..but I will not go to the college and beg principal for him.
Tell him that he doesn't have father.
- Mother!
Mother, I thought I didn't have mother till now.
Now father is saying that he is not there for me in spite of being alive.
What?
Are you planning to hang my photo on the wall?
I will not fall for your tricks.
lf you get up then only you will fall.
Just miss.
You may play any number of dramas I will not come to college.
Uncle..
Mother..
Bye.
- Hey, wait.
lf Ram doesn't study then nobody should study in this house.
Go inside.
Okay. I am going.
Don't do blackmail.
Yours.
Sir, I...
ls this marks list?
984867..
It looks like a mobile number.
Does it look like a marks list?
Sir, 72 percent in economics paper.
- You will get it.
lf you threaten the lecturer saying that.. ..you will pour acid on his face and write by.. ..cheating then you will definitely score it.
Oh!
Father, it is not acid.
It is water.
Mineral water.
Sir is in third year.
18 subjects are remaining to be cleared.
So sir didn't begin his studies till now.. ..after entering the college.
lf there are 4 boys like your son then we have.. ..to shut our colleges and start wedding halls.
I have understood, sir.
I was busy and lf you could give a chance this time..
I didn't call you for giving chance.
I have called you to give TC.
Yes.
Give it!
What have I got to do?
Give it!
Father.. - Give it right now.
Father..
Father.. - Why is he leaving by saying to give it?
Sir..
Sir.. - He is your father, isn't it?
Please, sir.
Please, sir.
Why are you talking as if a merit student is being given TC?
Get out!
Take TC and get out.
Hi, Pandu.
-Hi, Nimmi.
Tell me.
ls your husband in town or did he go to Mumbai?
Why are you not picking up the phone?
Two idiots were sitting in front of me till now.
Just now they left and I received your call.
By the way, what did you do about my new flat?
I have sold five medical seats without.. ..my correspondent's knowledge.
I have made one crore from it and kept it in the dust bin.
ls it?
So my flat is ready.
Flat number 401 in My Home apartments belongs to you from tomorrow.
Thank you, Pandu.
Come to Green Park hotel in the evening.
Both of us will sit there and talk about interior decoration.
Pandu!
Flat for me.
Hey, there are waiting in line over there.
I will come to you once they are finished.- Hello, Pandu!
Pandu!
Hello, Pandu!
I will definitely give.
Hey, who allowed you inside?
You will get the TC from the office.
Take it and go.
Hey!
Hey!
What is this?
Pandu, my father is very hurt.
What is Pandu?
Am I your friend?
Pandurangarao.
Principal.
Give respect.
Okay.
What is the rate of one flat in My Home apartments?
Why do you want the rate of flat in My Home apartments?
I got my own home.
So is this our second home, Pandu.
Hey!
What hey?
Your activities are cheap.
But you have put Gandhi's photo behind you.
One is at home..
One is at Green Park.
One is under the table.
Hey, who are you?
Go away.
ln order to cover these activities ..you fool the correspondent and hide money in dust bin.
Give your hands, son.
What do you want?
I want to see happiness in my father's face.
Call him.
Why did you call me again?
Why, sir?
Your son is a wonderful boy.
What if he didn't score marks?
Behaviour.. Behaviour is important, sir.
Do you know how much he respects his father?
What is the use of gold medals, sir?
They should be thrown into the dustbin.
Stop it. ls there admission or not?
Sir, I am taking this stress to say that there is admission.
What?
-Sir, I want to see happiness in your face.
I will never feel happy in his matter.
Oh!
My boy.
College topper!
No need to top the college.
First come to college.
That is sufficient.
Had there been a Cinderella like you in this college.. ..forget about myself coming to college.. ..l wouldn't have left it.
" Has the London's Cinderella come in front of me? " Has she pinched my heart? " " ls it dream or real? "
" My eyes have felt the thunder. "
" My heart felt the tender touch. "
" Did she throw the love net with that smile? "
" The waterfall inside my heart has come to see you. "
" Your face is fixed in my eyes. " I have forgotten the world by watching it. " " But that is not you. " " It is a sweetie naughty hutch dog. " " You are not the Cinderella. " " It is the simple looking slum dog. "
Move aside!
" You are that London's Cinderella. "
" Will you forgive me and come out for dinner? "
" Oh, Surrender Subbaiah. "
" Will you tell in simple words what the special dinner is? "
" Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen! "
" Let us drink mint leaves soup as starters for dinner. "
" Let us eat dumpling mixed with curd before the main course. "
" lf we could sip the best of milkshakes then.. ..our hearts will feel very happy. "
" Shall we finish it by directly eating the deserts? " No.
Shall we have milkshakes in between? " " Let us eat fish, lentils and vegetables. " Let us both watch movie with excitement. "
" This London Cinderella appreciates your taste. "
" But where does she have time for the date. "
" lf this wonder princess likes it within two minutes.. ..then she will love it. " " Nothing more than that.. "
" What is there with luck? "
" I will do it, baby? "
Hey..
Soup.
My favourite..
Fish.
Will you pay?
Hey, shall we go for movie?
- Movie?- Come on.
It is mind-blowing, dear.
- It is good.
Hey, will you drink milkshake?
- Yes.
Actually..
Hey, come.
Come.
Actually it wasn't that bad.
Enough now.
Hey, you didn't eat well.
Right?
For you.
And two minutes.
I love you.
What?
Did you plan to kill me?
- Brother..
Then why did you meet Puranapool Ashok.
Why will I meet that rogue?
Do you know what this is?
Navigator.
I kept it inside your scooter's dickey.
This will tell which places you visited.
It went to Puranapool Ashok's house yesterday at 11 o'clock.
From there you both went to Urvashi bar.
Everything is said by this babe.
Koka doesn't believe people.
He believes in technology.
What?
Will there be no bleeding if you perform an operation.
Our operation too is similar.
Sit down.
Sit down.
You have treated the girl in Gandhi hospital, isn't it?
Can we treat the girl by keeping her in some house or hotel?
No..
Not possible, sir.
Patient needs ventilator.
We should keep her on life supporting system.. ..and get MRl's done regularly.
- Stop it!
How many such cases are there in the city?
There must be around 10 to 15.
- That's it?
Hey, is it difficult to catch?
Go and search all the hospitals in the city.
What will you do now?
Play.
I will take my bishop.. - I have understood..
Check.
How is it?
Superb game.
You are very brilliant.
Hey, we should say that.
It is not sufficient if you compliment yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
Go and bring coffee.
Allowing you to enter the house is a big thing.
ln addition do you need coffee?
Go... and bring yourself.
Ram, I think you command lot of respect in this house.
You are mistaken.
I never feel angry when this sister says anything.- Why?
When we went to Annavaram in my childhood.. ..we saw an infant girl crying on the temple's staircase.
I saw her and cried saying that I want that girl to be my sister.
And then my uncle brought that girl and.. ...he is bringing her up like his daughter.
That girl is this girl.
- Does she know it?
How, Sravanthi?
How can we tell these matters to her?
Ram, you are so great.
Have you seen her?
Today she is going without caring for me.
Okay.
Let it be.
- Your house is superb.
Let us go to my room.
Come.
Friends of my orphan sister.
Today is Sunday. It is nonsense.
It looks really nice.
Okay.
What is it with you?
Why didn't you turn and look there?
I will see.
They will turn and see me.
They will fall for me after watching my cute face.
After that SMS', MMS', love letters and suicide threats..
Do we need all this?
This is experience, dear.
Experience.
ls it?
Did so many girls propose you?
Then?
- Hey!
Okay.
Okay.
Sorry.
Who proposed you for the first time?
Please.
Please.
Tell me.
First..
Sarita.
Hey, why did you give it to me?
I am your teacher.
It is okay, teacher.
Please, teacher.
Too much romance.
Second?
Second?
Malavika!
Malavika!
Malavika!...
Are you going out of town?
Yes. I am going to my grandma's house for summer holidays.
I will come back after a week.
I cannot wait for so many days.
Sorry. -It is okay.
Will you go after introducing your friend Usha till then?
There is too much violence.
- Violence?
Have you seen it?
You too got scared.
Brother.
Hey, brother.
My friends have come.
They don't know anything about you.
New batch.
All my old friends have left me because of you.
Sukanya friends are not coming to this colony at all.
Please don't come to my room today.
Please, brother. lf you want then I will hold your feet.
Get up.
Get up!
Go.
You shouldn't come.
- I have heard.
Go.
Ram.
Call her.
Why?
- Call her.
Ramya.
-Louder.
- Ramya!
What?
Come.
What?
Tell her what you did to her friends and Sukanya's friends.
Tell me.
What did I do to your friends and Sukanya's friends?
What?
-Louder.
What did I do to your friends and Sukanya's friends..
Are you asking me?
Sukanya.
He is asking what he did to our friends.
- What he did?
Hey, don't you know what you did?
Oh!
Silence!
Are you still listening to his stories, dear?
No, father.
Before he went aboard.. ..he told me to introduce him to uncle Seth's daughter.
Hey, stop!
What is the need for that topic now?
Hey, you wait.
I didn't introduce her.
He then went to that girl and told her that I am.. ..an orphan and was found at Annavaram temple.
Hey, when your aunt was suffering in giving birth to her.. ..l went to the bank and took a loan of two.. ..lakhs and got the caesarean surgery done.- Yes.
No, uncle.
Seth's daughter didn't understand the Hindi I spoke.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Shut up!
Don't I know you?
Hey, what is this meeting?
Why are you torturing a good boy?
Go.
Go from here.
Go.
Everything is revealed.
So who will believe when you call me good boy?
Sravanthi..
Ram! I am going to hospital.
Will you too come?
Hello.
Tell me, doctor.
What happened, aunt?
Hey!
Hey!
Who are you?
Sravanthi!
Ram..
We should give second injection in another five hours.
Hey, Bobby!
- Ram!
I need your help urgently.
- What?
Turn on the camera that is put in front of our hospital.
Freeze it!
Freeze it!
Now follow this ambulance and see at which signals it stops.
It didn't cross any signal after SR Nagar.
So it should be in SR Nagar.
Thanks, friend.
We will finish the entire family.
- Brother Koko..
Yes, boss.
Where is the girl's body? first if we talk about payment..
What?
Didn't I pay you already?
You said your life will be in danger if the girl is missed.
ls your life's value mere 25 lakhs?
How much you want?
Two crores.
- Okay.
Since you have agreed so easily it means the matter is quite serious.
25 crores.
Hey, you are acting smart.
Girl is already dead.
You cannot do anything.
Sir, if you are DK, I am KD.
I didn't kill the girl.
I kept her safe.
Are you mad? I will..
Where did you go?
What happened?
I felt someone was taking me away.
Therefore I came.
Body is here.
Rowdies are present here.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Why are you looking there?
Sir, why do you think so much?
You don't have other option too.
Sir, we don't need that much money.
We are ten people.
Give us ten crores.
That is sufficient.
We know where the girl is.
We will kill her.
I will give.
First kill the girl.
Sir, two minutes.
Two minutes.
Hey!
What happened to you?
Why doesn't anyone lift the phone?
Brother, some guy came here and he is beating us.
Hey, first remove her oxygen mask.
Don't spare hi too.

ls everything okay?
No.
Everything is not fine.
What happened to her, aunt?
- Not about her. It is about you.
I don't agree with anything you do.
Why were you running like a mad person sometime back?
I got scared thinking what would happen to you.
Will you die for her?
Tell me.
Tell me.
Will you die for her?
- Aunt, she is listening.
Let her listen.
She too must understand my grief.
Where is that girl?
Where is she?
Sravanthi.. - Dear, I beg you.
Spare my son.
I want my son.
I will give you life even by giving up my life.
But please don't play with him.
Please, aunt!
Please!
Nothing will happen to her.
She will survive.
Hey, it is not good to stay here for long time.
We should change the place urgently.
Not just place.
We should change the vehicle too.
Come.
Aunt.
-Bring her and come to our warehouse.
Okay, aunt.
Hey, go to our warehouse.
- Okay.
ldiots!
He thrashed all of you and took her away.
Where are you taking me to?
Sir, you don't take tension.
Koko has put a navigator in the girl's stretcher.
Let him take the girl anywhere, they will not escape from us.
Here is the navigator machine, sir.
Yes!
Go!
Come, sir.
Card problem.
Come here once.
'Dear, I beg you.
Spare my child.
'I want my son.'
Bring the vehicle.
Hey!
That is navigator.
They are following us.
First throw it away.
Why?
Why doesn't this society understand us?
Because you have got a wife and I have got a husband.
What did they do to us?
Ramani, our good time has begun.
Hey, Pandu.
I think they might rape me.
Hello.
Are you expecting it?
No!
No!
- I will thrash you!
Who is she?- Your wife?
- Yes.
Wife.
I mean some other person's wife.
My life.
Oh!
Affair?
Sir, you guessed it correctly.
Physics lecturer.- What is the need for my physique now, Pandu?
Where is the body?
What body, sir?
This is my body.
- Not your body.
Girl's body.
This is the girl's body, sir.
- Not this girl's body.
That girl's body.
- Which girl's body, sir?
Why do you beat me, sir?
Not just beating.
I will shoot you.
-Why, sir?
Where did you keep the girl's body?
I don't know the girl, sir.
Then what is this.
What is it, sir?
It looks different.
lf you don't know the body then how come.. ..this navigator is found in your car's backseat?
How can I tell you if you ask like that?
For example.
She is someone's wife.
She is in my car. lf you ask why then what will I say?
Sir, there are no answers for certain things.
Sir, I will consider her as my sister from today.
Yuck!
Useless fellow!
Go.
What did I say, sir?
Why is she calling me useless fellow?
Yuck!
Go.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Are you doing everything as per your wish.. ..by thinking that nobody is coming here?
Why are the doors of warehouse open?
Father?
- Hey, you.
Who has opened it?
Sir, your son took the keys from me saying.. ..that nobody should come here for two days.
Father.
What is the mistake that you committed.. ..due to which you came here to hide?
What trouble did you invite to me?
Father!
- Brother!
Brother!
- Brother!
Father!
- Brother!
- Father!
Father!
- Why did you do like this?
Brother, let us take him to hospital.
- Father!
How?
There is no hospital till 20 kilometres.
Revathi.
-Father!
Father!
It is okay.
Let us take him to the hospital.
There is no time.
First make uncle lie down on the ground.
Do it!
Touch below the chest.
Does it look swollen?
Yes.
- Tell them to bring a sharp.. ..knife and something like spirit.
Uncle, there is a first aid kit in father's car.
Bring the knife from it and vodka bottle from the dickey.
What is the need for them now?
- Bring them, uncle!
Are you coming?
-Hey!
Hey!
Why are you doing all this now?
Revathi is coming.
There is no time, uncle.
- What are you talking?
This is tension pneumothorax - This is tension pneumothorax
Air from his lungs is escaping into his chest.
Air from his lungs is escaping into his chest.
Open the shirt.
When we inhale when we are in tension.. ..and if lungs walls don't open up.. ..properly then air gets locked.
So the air has to be released immediately.
Fast!
-Take it.
First pour vodka in that place and clean it.
Now stab in that area.
Please believe me.
We are just making a small hole to release that air.
Open the cap of that bottle.
Keep it on that.
Press it.
Brother!
What happened, brother?
Revathi, like a big doctor.
He said bring the knife.. Tension pneumothorax
He did something and saved brother.
Though aunt doesn't like me,
I couldn't tolerate your pain and therefore came in front of you.
I am sorry.
" Oh, fly away my heart. " Go to any distance. "
" Will I not find you and come to you? " "
I am living in my heart. "
Whether it is a dream..
" Or if I am wide awake..
" Will I be able to live without you? "
" I am alive because of you. "
" It is because of love. "
" I will stay wherever you are. "
" I will come with you as you wish by becoming a shadow. "
" I will live for thousand years in the fort of your love. "
" Oh, I am the moving wind. "
" You are the waves inside me. "
" We cannot move without staying together. "
" Oh, I am the lightening thunder. "
" You are the spark inside me. " " We will stay together. "
" Oh, fly away my heart. "
" Go to any distance. "
" Will I not find you and come to you? "
" I am living in my heart. "
" Love is the oasis in sun. "
" However one may drink, the thirst of love.. ..cannot be quenched. "
" However one may fill their hearts with love.. ..it cannot be filled completely. "
Love has blossomed between us long back. " Love has disturbed our sleep and brought us together. "
'Sir, Madhav went to lndian saying his mother is unwell.
'He will return within a week.'
'Sir, I will change this number for security reasons.'
'Has he done all this?'
Sir, this is the doctor's house.
Do you want me to go and drag her out?
We don't want doctor.
We want patient.
She might not be here.
We will wait.
The last vaccine will be given today.
It is coming from morning's flight.
You go to the courier office and bring.. ..it so that there is no delay.
Hey, who is Sravanthi?
Sravanthi?
Who is it, brother - He should know.
Tell me.
Who is Sravanthi?
Sravanthi..
Who is it, father?
So did you call her name all night without knowing her?
Did I take her name?
- Yes.
I came to your room last night after seeing the lights on.
You were moving around in sleep and.. ..calling out Sravanthi..
Sravanthi
Who is that girl, son?
She is my friend, father.
There is a small problem.
That's why.. I might have called her name..
ls it a problem not to be disclosed to me?
Love?
Did her family come to know of it?
ls her father creating any problem?
Tell me. I will meet and talk.
My son is gold.
I will say that my son is gold.
Thanks, father.
Left!
Left!
Come, guys!
Hey, you go this side.
Boss! It is bit urgent.
Give it fast.
It is not possible if you say urgent.
Wait for half an hour.
There is an important medicine in that courier.
Why do you talk without knowing its urgency?
Look, the life of a girl depends on it.
lf you don't give it on time then she will die.
Please, boss.
Try to understand.
One minute, sir.
Sir, he is in the courier office upstairs.
Ram!
What happened?
Hey!
Leave it!
Go.
What is it?
- Aunt, take it.
Why are you coming running?
- First give the injection.
Where is Ram?
Hey!
Ram!
- Aunt, wait!
Hey!
Who are you?
No!
No!
You rogue!
Arrest him!
First my daughter needs to be shifted to the hospital urgently.
Put this rogue in jail.
- Sir, don't act in haste.
It is because of him that your daughter is still alive.
Mr. Commissioner. I called you up thinking that the situation.. ..here is going out of control.
No!
He and DK have planned it together.
Sir, you will not believe even if we tell what has happened.
Not only you but nobody in this world will believe it.
You daughter should tell the truth.
It is me, dear.
Father.
Who are they, father?
Arrest him.
" Oh heart, don't break down.
Don't become furious. "
" Don't change even if love turns out to be dangerous. "
" Oh, love is the reason for likes and troubles. "
" Love will not give the reason for anything anytime. "
" It is written already. "
" It is taking place as destiny. "
" Though memories pierce the heart, tolerate them as love. "
" You cannot avoid this ordeal. "
" Will love draw us apart? "
" Let the memories continue with the cycle of births. "
" Oh heart, don't break down.
Don't become furious. "
" Don't change even if love turns out to be dangerous. "
Sir, that boy and his aunt have taken lot of risk for your daughter.
It is true.
Excuse me.
Dr. Revathi.. - Yes.
She is in operation theatre.
You?
I am Chakradhar from Paris.
It will take one hour for the doctor to come out.
Please wait.
I am going to Paris.
Tell her that I will call later.
- Okay sir.
Sorry, son. I didn't believe it when your aunt said it.
But now I have understood the truth.
Thanks a lot, son.
What?
Did Sravanthi's father come?
Why?
Aunt, he said thanks.
- Thanks?
What does he think?
Did we take this risk for thanks?
Why doesn't he tell the truth he knows to Sravanthi?
I will go and ask.
No, aunt.
When she said that she doesn't know me.. ..then I don't have the strength to even go in front of her.
What if she is not there in my life?
She is alive, isn't it?
That's enough, aunt.
My love has won.
Farther, I am very sorry.
I gave you lot of trouble asking for freedom.
I will never say no to you any time.
What happened?
- Tyre is punctured, sir.
'lf that dreams comes true then I will love only him.. ...irrespective of his looks and the place he lives.'
'I will marry only him.'
A PuLi - DDR Presentation ;)
Before we move on to other functions, let's also take the partial derivative of our function here, f of xy, or the partial derivative of z with respect to y.
So let's do it in magenta.
Thank you Tom, it's a great pleasure to be here I'm very glad to have the opportunity to talk about the questions that concern me most in a context which allows us to talk a little bit about journalism and a little bit about ignorance and a little bit about abuse of power
The problem presented by The Press that is to say by the machinery of communication since we began industrializing communication and fighting ignorance in Europe, in the 15th Century
Everyone wants to talk about Internet freedom, except us. We don't want to talk about Internet freedom, we just want to do it. Join us.
OSHO OSHO International Foundation presents Osho:
"What would you like?" And he would ask me also,
"If you want anything I can note it down and bring it from Bombay." I never asked him.
Once I said, "I only want you to come back more human, less fatherly, more friendly, less dictatorial, more democratic.
"When I ask for money for books you had better give it to me."
He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "I simply mean that if you don't give it to me then I will have to steal it. I don't want to be a thief but if you force me then there is no way.
"Small children are not a problem to me; the problem is the older children. The smaller children - I respect them so much that they are very protective of my books." It was a strange thing to see in my house.
"This is simply not only unmannerly, uncivilized, it shows what kind of mind you have. To me a book is not just a book, it is a love affair. If you underline any book then you have to pay for it and take the book.
When the world was in darkness of ignorance, but india was shining bright with spiritual knowledge, for the beliefs of indian and the philosophy of brahma, and the power of knowledge, these temples are were the epitomes of it, so many fundamentalists attacked on such religion edifices...
kumbakonam, arakkonam, madurai, somnath, varanasi, oragallu, mahabalipuram, puri, hampi, lepakshi, not just one or two but so many temples from kashmir to kanyakumari, were reduced to ground, this is history before our constitution came into existence, even after independence, our temples are still not safe from attacks attack on akshardam is a living example for it,
terrorists who attacked akshardam must be cut into pieces.
Yes... yes...
- peace... peace... because of this peace, we've lost the temples forever in ramjanmabhoomi and somnath.
If you still wait saying peace, the remaining 138 holy places left in india, would become just pictures in post cards, you can't see it.
There are many politicians to protect our temples.
They're finding it difficult to save themselves.
Where do they've time for temples?
What should we do now?
Earlier there were protectors of temples in every region, we must start a brigade of protectors.
It means?
Man who will protect the temple giving his life, at tames would take lives too to protect it.
The protector must know all the traditional martial arts.
Where can we find volunteers to sacrifice lives to protect temples?
We're there!
You asked who would volunteer?
Look, how many have come forward.
Where can we find a martial arts teacher to train them in this modern age?
There's only one man in india who knows all the traditional martial arts.
Under the himalayas, beyond the confluence of rudra, karna, vishnu and deva prayags, he's in the takshasila, the traditional school of martial arts of medieval india.
A celibate bachelor, though over 70 years old, he's powerful enough to beat 100 men with one hand,
he prays lord badrinath every day his name is bheeshma narain.
How do we meet him?
Protect law and law will protect you.
All the martial arts i know, i'll teach to these kids.
Tell me the hymn i taught you.
Most difficult hymn in vishnusahsranamam.
It took me a month to learn it myself.
Mother!
Guru!
Please forgive us sir.
We're just cowherds, we mustn't sing these hymns, my son never listens to me.
Please forgive us if we've committed any mistakes.
Wrong?
Those kids couldn't repeat after learning it for days, but he heard it just once and repeating it perfectly, he's no ordinary kid, he's intelligent to grasp in one time.
Hand over you son to me.
I'll make him as powerful as sudarshan discus in lord vishnu's hands.
From today i'm accepting you as pure warrior clan member!
Badri, he's older to you in age.
More experienced.
Can you beat him?
No use in beating him on ground or water, guru, permit me, i'll take him into the sky and beat him.
There's no language in india which they don't know they've mastered every art in india, every warrior here is capable of killing 100 men without a weapon.
The martial arts we've learnt, we'll not use it for our selfish needs or for our family's sake, to protect the holy place, to protect it's holiness, we're ready to sacrifice our lives too!
Let's be devoted to our religion and respect other religions. Let's be devoted to our religion and respect other religions.
Choose yourself the temple you'll protect.
Kasi guruji!
Amarnath guruji!
Badrinath!
The first and foremost temple!
The holy place where lord vishnu stepped on earth for the first time.
The holiest place where the 8 syilable holy hymn of on lord vishnu was born.
It's badrinath, the holy shrine of lord sri hari... it's the heaven on earth, abode to wealth and holy shrine... as our saviour, lord vishnu's holy feet appeared on the hill... it's the place where sage vyasa wrote the holy vedas... the swirling river of alakananda is chant of lord vishnu... devotees of lord hari take a holy dip in the hot spring... it's a heaven that blesses you with knowledge and liberation... hail lord of badrinath!
River ganges flowing at the feet of lord hari washing the sins of people...
the river that isn't seen river virajaa flows down here... the mythical river saraswathi flows here... the rushing and gushing flow of river washes sins and gives boons... flowing rhythms and beats in tandem with the flow...
holy place to offer obsequious for the dead... washes the sins for generations...
as sage vyasa discourses on history and vedas...
lord ganapathi writes the holy vedas... four streams samaveda, yajurveda, rigveda and adharvaveda...
grandpa!
Call some hospital near by!
This is forest area, you can find trees not signals.
I warned not to go to badrinath, let's stay back in bellary, uncle.
He didn't listen.
I think it's difficult to take the body too from here.
You'll never listen.
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Who is he?
- What happened?
My grandpa fell unconscious suddenly.
Move!
Who are you?
Already my grandpa has lung problem, why are you pouring mud?
Shut up! This is mud of holy mountain narayana!
Lord vishnu is there in every grain of the mud.
Move... give us way!
Badri, come here!
Hey badri!
Chop her!
Sir, my grand daughter hates gods!
Please tell him not to kill her.
Badri!
Save the girl!
Save her!
I thought she'd die but returned safely.
She hates gods, so she mustn't be in this holy place, send her away.
Send her away!
As a punishment for blowing out one lamp, she must light 1 lakh lamps.
1 lakh?
Oh allah!
God gave us mouth to eat when hungry and to yawn when sleepy. That's all, not to blow lamps in temples.
Never listens to me.
What are you doing there?
The punishment is for the girl only.
There's the game of cricket, its not played by one player, right?
There's kitchen in 5 star hotel, but there won't be only one cook, forget that, take our temple offers prayers, but it isn't offered by one priest only, about 10 to 15 priests conduct it.
Isn't it?
Why are you staring at me?
Thinking if i throw you into the river, would one man or a group will come to save you?
You must do it alone, finish it quickly, let's go.
I'm doing it, right?
Blown away!
When will she finish it like this?
You can ask to light one lamp for blowing one, even 10 lamps is okay, even 100 is also reasonable, how can anyone light 1 lakh lamps?
- Shut up!
Look, light it with devotion, it'll burn.
If you do it for doing sake, it'll blow off like this only.
How can one light it with devotion?
Lts lighted with match stick.
No it'll not, chant the holy 8 syilable hymn and light it, it'll burn.
Already she's punished to light 1 lakh lamps, do you want her to chant the hymn 1 lakh times?
That too this girl.
- Yes she only!
This is will not end.
I'll light it, watch!
Girl, i think it's working!
Whether you like it or not chant hymn and light it.
Listen at least this one!
You'll finish it.
Don't wake her up!
Let her at least spend a night in the holy sanctorum of god.
Why is she so angry on god?
When she was little girl, her mother while putting camphor in the sacrificial fire...
if you tie this holy thread, god would be with you.
Hubby... hubby... mother!
Mother!
Father!
Mother!
Watching her mother and father die in the temple fire, alakananda lost trust on god.
Why did you bring a girl who hates god to this holy place?
Her life is in danger.
Sarkar is coming!
Mother, number of people who were killed by father, and people who died for father has reached 98 with him.
Sarkar is in delhi.
Meet me after the rituals and obsequious.
Already it's too late, take the body.
- Okay madam. Just a minute madam.
Madam, an elderly man helped my husband while he was dying.
He wrote in his diary not to cremate him without the old man paying respects.
I've informed him on phone, he'll be on the way, madam.
Who is that elderly man?
- G d naidu!
Grandpa isn't well, so i'm here on his behalf.
Please pour the holy water in his mouth, madam.
Why? Would he come back alive if pour the water?
I hate such silly sentiments.
Think about your children's future.
Do you know who am i?
Your paternal aunt!
I'm wife of sarkar who rules this state.
Call me aunt once, my brother, i mean your father would be happy.
Without claiming to be daughter of gd naidu who saved so many lives, aren't you ashamed to say proudly that you're wife of a mass killer!
The day you left from the marriage against my grandpa's wish, you're not a member of our family, i never wanted to see you in my life, infact i feel irritated to talk to you.
I'll never call you as aunt till i'm alive.
Hey get up!
- Who are you guys?
What's this?
Hey, old man!
Do you know who am i?
I'm your lone daughter's lone son.
My mother told me never to look at you or your property or your fame.
My father as his wife and i as my mother respect her so much, but your grand daughter humiliated her in public, i would've cut her into pieces there itself.
But my mother stopped me, so she's still alive.
I'll not let her live for long.
I'll kill her.
I don't know how long i would live.
I can give wealth but can't protect her.
I've come this far seeking god's protection.
You must make her believe in god.
You forget it sir, this is very simple matter.
In just 7 days i'll make alakananda to circumambulate bodily!
What will you do man?
We're leaving this place in 7 minutes.
Come grandpa.
- Stop dear.
Day after tomorrow is full moon day, your parents' death anniversary.
If you offer obsequious in brahma kapalam once, you never have to offer again in life.
Their souls too would rest in peace.
Grandpa!
- Please dear.
Okay, i'll go for the sake of mother and father.
But i mustn't see his face.
Impossible!
Nobody can escape from badri in badrinath.
Let it be anyone, he must bow his head to talk to me in vasudhara falls.
Whether it is cm or pm or anyone, must bow his head before me.
Are you so great man?
See my album to know how great i am!
I think you're abusing me in your heart.
I want to abuse you openly, avoiding it because it's temple.
Such a build up for this job!
Is my job so cheap to you?
Please don't get so angry.
- Sir, you've tonsured my head half only.
He'll do the rest half of it.
I swear i don't even know to shave also.
Now do it for him, shave yourself tomorrow, now take this.
Take it!
Tonsure his head!
I'm bleeding!
You'll bleed if there's cut, not any scent.
Consult a doctor, ask him to save the rest.
If he refuses, i'll do it, go!
You please sit here.
- Why? To shave your head.
People tonsure heads in tirupathi or kasi to fulfill vow.
Why here?
I'll not take money freely from anyone.
Why should you take money?
Because you belittled my profession.
- If i refuse?
You'll not go from this place.
Take it out.
Rs.1000!
Take it, rs1000!
- Rs.800 only!
I'm poor in maths.
- Then, why not give me rs.1200?
There's always a robber like him in every tourist place.
What man?
I just asked for fun, why did you give me cash?
I was just testing you.
What's it badri?
Tonsure heads, don't pick pockets.
- Okay badri.
He comes at right time.
How are you doing baba?
- I'm fine son.
Vasudhara...
it's breathtaking waterfalls... it's flowing down majestically... i'm warning you, people who don't believe in god, crooks, cheats, deceivers mustn't go under the waterfalls.
Why? What would happen if we enter?
Waterfalls will not fall on them, it goes back.
How would water know the truth?
Nature here has the power to recognise sinners.
I feel there's no one worse than me in this world.
That's what i too feel!
That's why i'm warning you not to go.
I'll go, let me see how can it not fall on me.
Okay, try it.
Great man has come to test me!
How can water go back?
Why isn't it going back?
It's going back!
It has vanished!
You shameless creature!
Don't you feel ashamed?
You've come to such a holy place!
Hey you buffalo!
- Get out from here!
Some atheist is here, send him out from badrinath.
No need, i'll go away myself.
Go man!
- Am i so insensitive?
I've seen many worse fellows but you're the most worst.
The waterfalls has vanished.
Where are you coming from?
- No need of those details.
See that the waterfalls come down as usual.
I think sadhus would kill me!
I think this waterfalls is very dangerous, if we get our politicians to stand under it, many of them would get caught.
You go sir.
Why are you taking the risk, uncle?
Go sir.
Don't get tempted and go under it in any circumstance.
Situation is worst there.
Listen, i tried and it came back somehow.
If you go, it'll go away permanently.
Though you're worst fellow, you said it rightly.
Not a drop will fall on you even in 100 births!
Will it fall on me?
No way, i'll not let it fall on me.
I came here on picnic and they say obsequious.
I'm getting bored.
Shall we start the game?
This is cricket not basket ball played by 6 players.
We need 5 more players.
What shall we do now?
I'll get the team ready in 5 minutes.
Here come the scapegoats!
Why did you call us?
- Where are you going?
We're not going, infact we're coming.
We're coming from veda school to the mutt.
What are those books?
This book has everything about this world.
Is it?
Hail lord hanuman!
What a lousy question?
There isn't anything on this earth which i don't know.
Then, do you know everything?
I know.
Then, i'll ask you just 3 questions, will you answer me?
I'll tell you, ask me.
Who is rajinikanth?
Rajinikanth?
Come closer boys!
Who is this rajinikanth?
- Our guru never told about him.
Do you know?
No? Don't you know?
It has about suryakanth and chandrakanth but no rajinikanth.
Did you see?
There are many things which the book hasn't got any idea about.
That's okay, by the way who is he anyway?
Rajinikanth is tamil superstar!
Is it him?
I know him very well.
Do you know chiranjeevi?
What are you saying, girl?
Is there anyone in this world who doesn't know chiranjeevi?
Has megastar visited badrinath?
- I don't know.
Is chiranjeevi written about in your veda?
There is!
Not just in veda, it's written in entire world about lord hanuman.
Were you talking about that chiranjeevi?
I didn't ask about that chiranjeevi?
- Then? About megastar chiranjeevi!
I don't know anything about stars.
Ask me something else.
- Okay.
Do you know dhanadhan dhoni?
Dhanadhan dhoni?
We know only dhoti not dhoni.
Better know it, he's a cricketer.
Recently he won the world cup for us.
What's this world cup and cricket?
Don't you know about the favourite game of lord vishnu?
Lord vishnu's favourite game?
Yes, his three lines on forehead are these wickets.
How to play this game?
If you hit the center wicket, you'll reach heaven directly.
If we hit the side wicket?
- You go to the trishanku heaven.
Hail lord narayana!
Favourite game of lord vishnu, don't play throwing by stones.
What should i hit with?
Hit with this!
What is this?
- Sweet laddu!
Tirupathi laddu?
Why is it like this?
It becomes like this after drying in sun for a year.
Bowl now!
To heaven directly.
Hail lord narayana!
Boys, escape!
Go back!
What happened?
You don't know the difference between fun and culture.
Tell me your father's name.
The dead man is not my father but my son and daughter-in-law.
Only children must offer obsequious to parents, hindu tradition don't allow father to offer obsequious to son.
Then, i'll offer it for my parents.
Women are not allowed to do this.
If you're married, your husband can do it.
She's not married.
- Any of your male relative can do it.
You please do it for them.
Priest in my place told me not to offer food also.
How can i offer obsequious?
Then, do one thing, there would be people who offer obsequious to orphans.
Get them to do it, we'll pay for it.
Nobody here offers obsequious here for money.
Why are you making my parents orphans with such sentiments?
I'll go now...
- wait priest!
Please sit down.
I'll do it for them.
You offer prayers every day with your hands to lord badrinath, how can you offer obsequious to orphans?
What's wrong in it?
Customs are there for doing good things.
Not to become hurdles.
Dead body is considered as god in any religion.
Only we hindus treat it as bad omen.
Dead are equal to lord shiva.
Alakananda's parents died in a temple.
Offering obsequious to them is like offering to god.
You start the function.
Who are you folding your hands for?
Badri or lord badrinath?
For badri!
Terrorists attacked amarnath temple, demanding release of their men in jail, if they don't, they've threatened to kill the devotees, and killed the protector of amarnath temple.
What?
I'm giving you 5 minutes time.
Not one of you must be here at 6th minute.
It's we who must lay conditions.
Not you!
We're not runners but make you run away.
I'll kill every one of you.
I'll kill all the devotees.
What now?
Badri, i'm giving you 5 minutes only!
Not one of them must be alive at 6th minute.
He mustn't escape, kill him!
Kill that bastard!
Kill him, don't spare him!
We must congratulate your courage to face them without any weapon... how could you come here bravely without any weapon.
He's my weapon!
Ultimate missile!
Badri said not a drop would fall on me even in 100 births.
Now i love him.
I love him sincerely.
If my love is true, fall on me.
What will fall?
Neither vasudhara nor badri would fall for you.
Why?
What do i lack?
You don't have much devotion towards lord badrinath.
The moment i started loving him, all that he likes i too like it.
Now i like badri as well as lord badrinath.
He challenged with grandpa to make me believe god in 7 days.
Tell him i'll be there in temple in 7 minutes as he wishes.
Good news.
I like you...
I'll not leave you... i've approved you... be my partner... i liked and sought... this waterfalls has blessed me... i wish to tie the knot with you... hereafter i'll be your shadow...
i'll meditate till i see him... i know what to ask if god appears... my youth is dying to be with you... my heart is pulling me towards you... anger or romance, it must be with me only...
life or death is with you only... my dear, i've heard your silence... i'll come my dear, to be with you all my life...
bachelorhood has become burden... wishes the union to happen at the earliest... i'm getting used to your thoughts... my heart is pushing me to commit the mistake... waterfalls itself is thrilled with your touch... can i be that lucky?
Did i say no, my mate?
Let the fun begin... would i deny you?
If you ask me, won't i happily jump into your lap?
Hey girl!
Can't you watch and walk?
Why are you rushing?
- Can't you watch and walk?
See, how arrogant she is?
Rich are always like this.
Their eyes are never on ground, always on their gold.
Couldn't you ask your father to make your skin also of gold?
If there's necessity, i'll have it done, so what?
If you talk too much, i'll slap you!
Beat me...
- what?
What's the problem?
She's proud and moreover threatens to slap me.
If you say proud, i will... stop!
Do you know who she is?
Badri's mother and father!
Dare to slap her now!
Why has she become like that?
Who do you think she is?
The girl who loves badri, your future daughter-in-law.
Scold her now!
Greetings mother-in-law.
- See, how cultured she is!
She has greeted me.
Rich people are never proud. - Is it?
How much she's worth?
- Around rs.1000 crores.
How much is rs.1000 crores?
One can buy anything between himalayas and indian ocean.
She's in hot sun!
Give me this... why can't you keep a bigger one?
Rich like us mustn't roam in sun.
- Like us?
We're rich, aren't we?
- Already become rich.
Isn't she my daughter-in-law?
- Yes mother-in-law.
Did you know why the elderly man has called us here urgently?
Why?
To discuss about their marriage only.
- Is it?
Come. Go.
Golden girl!
It's hot sun!
Where are you going?
If you go that side, it's love marriage.
I can't say if it'll happen or not.
If you this side, it's arranged marriage.
It's definite to happen.
Isn't it?
- Yes.
Mother-in-law!
Look at my daughter-in-law, she's shining bright!
- Yes you too join us.
- I'll listen from here.
Go fast. - okay.
Greetings sir.
- Greetings sir.
Govind?
You called us urgently.
I've taken a decision about your son.
To discuss it with you.
Didn't i say it's about his marriage?
- You keep quiet.
What's it sir?
Badri saved holy amarnath and devotees there, and brought laurels to me.
He's your disciple, right?
Your son is the lone man who can keep these traditional martial arts alive.
That's why i'm thinking of making him my heir to takshasila after me.
As you wish sir, he's like your son, sir.
There's a strict practice which he must follow.
The man who would be my heir must remain a celibate bachelor all the life.
You mean he mustn't marry at all, sir.
- No, he mustn't.
To protect the tradition of takshasila, i, my guru, his guru remained bachelors.
I want your permission as his parents.
Think over it and decide.
What's this?
Tell him we don't need to head mutts and monasteries.
Look at her, how sad she is!
We must be thinking about our son not that girl.
Marriage, having children isn't just for humans, even animals do ii, but heir to takshasila, one a billion would get that chance.
We must be proud of it not feel sad.
Only if you agree wholeheartedly, i'm not forcing it on you.
We agree sir.
- Sir, i'll ask my son... he's my disciple, he'll never say no to me.
Why are you dull?
It seems you promised to pray, how would you do it?
Will you fold hands?
Entire body on ground?
Circumambulate bodily on ground?
What should i do?
I'll not do it.
- It seems you said so.
I thought like that but now i've changed my mind.
What happened so suddenly?
I love a man and i'm losing him.
Tell me who is he, i'll brig him and arrange your marriage.
I love... he's my disciple, he'll never say no to me.
Forget it, not just you, not even your lord badrinath can do it.
What do you know about this holy place?
Tomorrow is the holy day when a lamp is lit and temple remains closed for 6 months.
Snow covers the temple for 6 months.
When the temple door is opened after 6 months, the lamp would still be burning.
Is it?
Yes, there's no better evidence than this to prove god's existence.
There's no place in this world holier than this place.
Make a wish tomorrow when the lamp is lit, come back on the day the temple door is opened, you'll definitely marry your lover.
- Really? Yes, but there's a condition.
You must offer brahma lotus a favourite of badrinath while making the wish.
Where can i find it?
- Come with me.
Greetings sarkar.
- Why are you dull, minister?
Opposition leader's son has eloped with my daughter.
I don't want him alive, i'm paying rs.50 crores.
You asked me to settle land deals, i did it, you asked me to kill rival contractors, i did kill them, you asked me change your power, i did it, how many crores you may offer, i'll not interfere in love matters.
Greetings sir.
- I couldn't attend your husband's funeral.
You're... mahalakshmi!
Do you want to mix his marital remains in andhra pradesh?
Or you want to go to allahabad?
His death resulted in the humiliation of your wife, sir
what happened?
Aren't you ashamed to call yourself wife of a mass killer?
I'll never call you as aunt till i' alive.
Do you want me to kill her?
Should i wait for you to kill her?
If i hadn't stopped, my son would've killed her.
She swore never to call me aunt, but i want her to call me mother-in-law all my life, for that my son must marry her.
This is my first and last wish.
Where is she?
Greetings sir.
Where is alakananda?
There's a young man badri in badrinath, she's having a blast on the night of moonbeam, a day of union, you mean?
- She's in love with him.
Who is he?
If you want know him, watch tv channels and see newspapers on november 15.
He'll rule over the entire media.
I want her here in 24 hours.
What's the most powerful thing in this world?
Rowdyism, politics, and money.
- No, it's love!
Till now we killed people for wealth and one-upmanship, but for the first time we're interfering in love matter, do you know how powerful this love is?
States and kingdoms have ruined because of it.
Confirm thrice the death of badri after killing him.
Not checking his body but by testing his breath.
If he's alive, don't bring alakananda here, go now.
Okay dad.
Are wild beasts there in this forest?
Elephants!
- I'm not scared of it.
Because they obey your orders, right?
They're wild elephants not temple elephants to obey my commands.
Don't ask silly questions, come.
Be careful, a slip can break your teeth.
I'm not worried, you're there to hold me, right?
Should these flowers bloom here only?
It's torturous!
This is not torture, it begins much later.
More torturous than this, i can't go any further. - Come fast!
What?
Tired already?
You must have stamina!
What stamina?
Never went out without car or walked without shoes from my childhood.
Never ate without a spoon.
And you're taking me around the forest.
I can't.
Then your love will be a failure.
You won't get your lover.
Tell me!
Tired already?
You must have stamina!
That's not the way, you must go this side.
Don't know who her lover is, he's finished.
Be careful, there are snakes.
I'm scared of it.
Are brahma lotuses there?
No, you've to beyond the neelakanta mountain.
She's finished today, come.
An idea, tell him to give that lotus, i'll offer it with my hand.
How is it?
If you're hungry, would you eat or the person next to you?
You love a man and you want to marry him, you must pluck the flower and offer it yourself.
They're brahma lotuses.
Be careful, it's an ice bridge!
These are stronger than the city cement bridges.
You're little crazy!
You know that?
Will you please help me?
Don't worry, try again.
I'll help you.
Try!
I'm slipping!
Nothing happened, no problem.
Don't get scared.
- I'm scared.
I told you not to get scared.
Why are you then scared?
Stop! If you don't pluck this time, you'll not fall, i'll push you.
Pluck!
Go!
Hurdles everywhere, i'm sure something is wrong with your love.
No, i'm correct in my love, so i got it.
Where is badri?
I don't know guru, he's missing since last night.
It's time for the glimpse of holy lamp.
Come fast, temple will be shut.
He's the danger my grandpa told you about, badri.
Are you the temple security gorkha?
If you call gorkha and dare to take a step, i'll rip out your heart.
Alakananda, go and offer prayers making wish to marry your lover.
Let me who will dare stop you.
Go!
You go!
- No i won't.
Why?
They'll not let me come here after 6 months.
If you promise to bring me back here after 6 months, i'll enter temple.
Let he, his father or mother or the entire state may descend here, i promise to take to have the glimpse of the lamp after 6 months.
I promise!
Write your names on the wish list.
People who offer brahma lotus and make a wish now, if they visit after 6 months to have the glimpse of the holy lamp, their wishes would get fulfilled.
Till now i never believed in god, but i believe you wholeheartedly, take away badri from bheeshma narain and make him my husband, god!
Lord, i've never made any wish till date, i'm making a wish now, make badri heir to takshasila and fulfill my wish.
No man can stand against him, his only weakness is god.
I'm responsible for all this.
No problem, don't worry.
I'll be fine.
How dare you love a girl who has come here as a devotee!
Stop!
How many more times will you stab him?
Stop!
He's dead!
Let's go.
You come i say!
Listen carefully, devotees to badrinath!
This temple will be closed from today for 6 months.
Entire place will be covered by snow.
Please don't stay here as the weather condition is dangerous to humans.
The temple will open after 6 months only.
Devotees must visit this temple only during that period.
Super place!
Remove the shoes, it may wear out.
Why should we remove the shoes?
You're so huge yet no brain.
How would people in chilakaluripet know if wore shoes here or not?
Let's remove clothes too, father.
How would people in chilakaluripet know if wore clothes here or not?
Where are you going?
We're going to badrinath to mix my father's mortal remains there.
Badrinath is closed, come after 6 months.
What? Should we return after 6 months?
It took us 6 months to reach here, we'll be back just in minutes.
I don't know anything, it's shut for 6 months.
Go back.
We can't come back here again.
There's a small village near by, let's stay in a lodge there.
Who will pay for the lodge?
Your dad? I'll make my dad pay for it, but i can't go and come back here.
Dad, let's stay, anyway grandpa is going to pay.
Let's inflate food bills and take extra money from him.
Shut up!
Some day i'll go mad with your stinginess.
Your father must pay in cash as soon as i produce the bill.
That's why i'm going from here.
How did you know we're from peta?
I know you're from peta, you've hidden two pairs of shoes, and you're searching for a lodge, and you've committed a mistake by marrying him, i know everything.
- You go man.
I'll not go and not let people of peta go too.
You're from peta and i'm from peta, we're from peta.
Okay, do one thing, find a lodge where they offer two beds free for one bed.
Because we both belong to peta.
No need of lodge, stay with me in my peta ashram, exclusively for the people of peta.
Where's the ashram?
No need, they'll steal money in the name of ashram.
We don't need it.
What do you say son?
Yes dad, let's find some cheap lodge.
Come, let's go.
Everything is free in peta ashram.
Dad, everything is free there!
You mustn't ask money after 6 months.
None will not be asked from the people of peta.
Even if they ask, would we pay, dad?
You're right!
Okay, come.
- That side. - come.
They're finished!
Everybody think badri is dead but he's alive!
Really, grandpa?
Yes dear, you'll certainly marry badri.
Blessed with eternal life and good health...
i'm born again and living for you only... i've come down to your way... i've aimed you, and hit the bulls eye... i've come to you, my dear angry girl... did my anger call you?
Did you realise it?
Has the flower garland of my youth fascinated you?
Your thoughts have spread a charm of spell to bring me here?
As your rain of wishes drench me, my heart is moving towards you... i'm writing a love song with the letters of my life...
would everything written come true?
Have you met what's not written?
Has a stone started melting with feelings?
Come sir.
I'm here to give the opportunity to alakananda to call my wife as mother-in-law priest, we've followed different guru.
Do you know why you've been brought here?
If you fix the auspicious time, my father-in-law would approve it.
Fix an auspicious time.
According the girl's horoscope, most auspicious day is when the badrinath temple reopens after 6 months.
But your father-in-law doesn't like that time. - Why?
Because his daughter's marriage didn't take place on the same day.
No problem!
My father will be happy for alakananda's marriage taking place on the same day.
Fix that day!
Do you know how great is my son, father?
To fulfill my wish, he killed badri, a man alakananda loves.
Father, i've brought rs.1 crore worth golden banares sari for my daughter-in-law.
Change the heart of my niece and bring her to get engaged.
The day you married this murderer, i ordered my son to kill you.
But, do you know what your brother told me?
He stopped me saying its my sister's will and wish.
Without knowing all this, will you come to force marriage on your niece?
Are you human?
This marriage will not happen till i'm alive.
Mother!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
You said this marriage will not happen till you're alive.
That's why i killed you!
Grandpa... grandpa...
- sir... auspicious time my father-in-law likes is fixed.
Grandpa!
Will hanging your head in shame make it right?
Hanging head doesn't mean he has committed the mistake.
He never raises his head before guru.
The girl who came to badrinath without belief in god, did he go out with her leaving the temple without any love on her?
When they came to take her away just before the temple is shut, he shouted her name loudly, did he call her name loudly without any love on her?
He called her because he loves her.
He's hung his head in shame because he committed the mistake.
The mistake he did was making you a brahmin without bothering about your caste, though he has so many disciples, he chose you as his heir to head takshasila.
Take away your son from here.
Guru, i didn't commit any mistake.
Trust me.
What's this son?
Don't sacrifice your life for someone else to believe you.
Stop son!
He has taught you everything, tell him he taught you to lie.
Guru, i swear on lord badrinath, i have not loved any girl till now.
I'll never love anyone in future too.
I'll never do anything you don't like or approve.
Trust me.
You're my hope!
Keep it afloat!
There will be thorns, walk carefully.
Be careful.
How long and how many more days we've to walk?
We've reached!
That is peta ashram.
Please come!
Who is it?
Two cows and a calf have come from peta.
Cows?
Are we cows?
Cows are soft in nature, they give milk but don't drink milk.
People of peta are...
- like cows!
Why is he repeating the name?
He goes crazy on hearing peta.
Stop it.
Nobody came here from peta, not a woman came here in 25 years, now a woman has come.
He told us free but i don't think he's from peta, he's like a kidnapper, moreover i'm wearing a million worth jewels on me.
Million... million... you said it once but he's repeating it so many times, i feel you're right.
Feelings?
Love, selfishness, anger, pity, hatred, ego, fear, money, jewels, it's for ordinary people like you, not to man who has side tracked death and lived for 500 years.
500 years?
Look at this jewel given to me when i met king srikrishna devarayalu.
It's value could be rs.50 lakhs in market.
You can get rs.40 lakhs if you pawn it.
Take it. Go but don't ask me how did i live for 500 years?
What's wrong if we ask?
Shouldn't people of peta know it?
But sir, you look like a 50 year old man, we can't believe you've lived for 500 years.
He may look like a diabetic chinese but he'll never lie.
But as people of peta...
- we're all from peta, tell him son.
Let's go in.
Welcome please... look there!
Chupke with gandhiji!
Chupke with mother teresa!
Chupke with nehru!
What's so great about it?
Many people display such photos.
You're wrong.
Chupke with young gandhi, teresa, and nehru!
He met buddha too, but no cameras then, so no photos.
You're great sir!
When i heard you lived for 500 years, i didn't believe it, but now that i've seen this, i've started believing it. - Yes.
You're shocked for this, his guru is 2000 years old.
2000 years?
Has a man lived for 2000 years?
Aren't there trees and hills as old as that why can't man live then?
He lived and let me live.
- Who is he?
Can we meet him sir?
Not just meet him, if you wish, he can make also live.
Let's live, daddy.
You keep quiet son, he may ask money.
It's free for people of peta!
- Dad, it's free!
Let's live!
If it's free, let's live!
If you go now, i'll finish the drink.
What happened madam?
Open the door!
What happened?
Open the door!
What happened?
Bloody satan!
Why are you torturing her?
Why didn't you kill her also along with her grandpa?
What nonsense you're saying?
If he wanted to kill her, he would've killed her when she insulted me.
I stopped him.
Once you marry her, she'll be loyal like a dog.
Come!
Badri!
How are you?
Alakananda!
How are you, badri?
They killed my grandpa and forcibly got me engaged to him.
I'm little courageous thinking that you're alive.
The hope that if i've the glimpse of holy lamp, i'll unite with my lover, that's keeping me alive.
I'm really very sad.
If it's possible come for me little earlier.
They've ordered badri not to step into badrinath for creating trouble for his love.
Who?
Temple trusts and endowments uttarakhand you've doubted my disciple, tell them i'll also not step there.
He'll not leave me and i can't live without him.
The temple will be covered by snow.
When the temple is opened after 6 months, the lamp would still be burning.
Come... come...
- they're coming.
Batting baba is inside.
No reply from him.
- Wait, he will reply.
Batting baba, i'm chupke here!
Why isn't he responding to you also?
He'll reply now.
Baba, two cows and a calf have come from peta.
Come in... come in.
You're great!
How did you get his idea?
Simple dad, he came for this call only.
You're right.
Golden boy!
Come!
Greeting from chupke baba!
Which year is this?
- 2011, swamy!
Have 500 years passed in meditation?
Meditating for 500 years?
Why are you surprised?
That's routine for him.
Do you want me to tell the highlights of 2011?
No need, i know everything.
Did they kill bin laden?
- Yes!
Did india win world cup?
- Yes!
I told you to send holy water to japan in 2010, did you do it?
Forgot it?
How is japan now?
- Washed away in tsunami.
Don't curse me, swamy!
- I curse you to become hutch dog.
Baba, you're great!
Who are you?
Where are you coming from?
We are coming from chilakaluripet.
- Peta? I came there long back when i was young about 1500 years ago.
How is peta now?
- Did you come to peta?
Yes i did.
- That too 1500 years ago?
If you've lived for 2000 years, you would've seen dinosaurs, right?
Just see?
I used to make omelettes from dinosaur eggs.
Tippu sulthan used to come and request to give him.
I used to say get out.
Tippu was there?
He was born about 300 years ago only.
The tippu you know is his fourth birth, if you irritate him, he'll start meditating again, may take 500 years to break it again.
No sir, we'll tell him what for we're here.
Swamy, we too want to live for 1000 years like you.
I can do it.
- Your mercy.
Just you alone?
- No, entire family.
1000 each!
You mean family package?
- Yes. - okay.
Do one thing, sit before that wisdom plaque.
Yes swamy!
- What are you waiting for?
Come mom.
The hymn i'll teach you now, chant once a year for 1000 years.
Okay swamy!
When you're chanting, you feel like someone is stealing yourjewels, don't open your eyes under any circumstances.
What would happen if we?
He turned into hutch dog and you'll turn into pomeranians.
We'll not open, don't open your eyes.
You too son.
- Yes dad.
Close your eyes!
- We've swamy!
We've been cheated!
I feel like someone's stealing my jewels.
Mad woman! It is happening as baba told us.
Dad, i feel someone has snatched my gold chain.
Baba said that, right?
We've been cheated!
I've finished 1000, shall i open my eyes?
If you've, then open your eyes.
Open your eyes, hubby.
- I've not yet finished.
Shut up and open your eyes.
- What? Read that!
- What should i read?
Man living 100 years is useless, what would you achieve by living 1000 years? You fools!
Why would he be here?
I've lost all my gold and left with this ash.
Dad, we've been cheated.
Sign here.
Got a parcel from badri!
What's this?
Mud from the holy mount narayana.
Please don't stamp on it, lord vishnu is there in every particle.
Vishnu in mud? I think she's mad.
Look after her carefully.
Why did he send mud instead of coming to save you?
They mustn't know badri is alive.
Essence of amba... jagadamba... my spine is shaken... my right eye is batting... quintessential of lambadhari... bramaramba... my cheek is shivering and my palm is trembling... we both are on either shore, our wishes have about to be fulfilled... day and night your thoughts and i'm sleepless... badrinath got shaken up, brought together and united us...
every word you utter is a musical concert to me... where ever you take me, it's ajourney in palanquin to me...
any place you're is heaven to me... any mischievous act of yours is ploy of cupid to me...
love is that shore and pangs of separation on this shore lost to us... yesterday is that shore and today on this shore gives way to our future...
i'm building a wall of my arms around you not to leave for moment also... unsatisfied with just embrace, i blew the bugle of kisses... unsatisfied with kisses, i'm opening the way of honey... unsatisfied with honey, i'm giving you myself, o my love... romance on one side and shyness on the other, a bridge has been built... heaven on one side and earth on the other have come together...
you've overshot by half!
You've under quoted by a half shut up!
Is it wine shop to say in quarter, half and full?
This is for you, this is for him and this is for me.
This is for you, this is for him...
- what about my share then?
He has come!
They would've also come.
He came when we were sharing the booty in kasi.
You've come while sharing the booty here.
Other than destroying we criminals, doesn't your family has any job?
If you know how difficult it is to cheat others, you won't make such entries!
Silly!
Stop narrating tales and return theirjewels.
My hands know only to take not to give, tell them to take it themselves.
We're lucky!
Give my waist girdle, bloody!
Dad, let's take his ring too.
- That's not ours, right?
Keep quiet, i'll take it as mine.
The ring he's wearing belongs to us, sir.
It's a ring with lucky white precious stone.
That's why i'm wearing it.
My grandpa gave when my dad refused to consummate marriage, right dad?
You're so crooked at this age!
If you give it yourself, just ring only, if i take it out, you'll lose finger also along with ring.
No need, i'll give the ring, i want my finger.
Take it, you fat boy!
- Take it.
Don't ever try to cheat people of peta.
We'll take leave.
- Get lost.
You're job is done.
He chased us out of kasi and we came here.
You're here to torture us.
Where should we criminals live?
You can live anywhere as good men, but if you want to live like this, then no need to live anywhere.
Moral?
Take it down boys!
To avenge you've forced this marriage on her, who would you wish to be invited as the first guest?
Write the first invitation to our guru!
How are you doing, sarkar?
My son is getting married, guru.
I can't attend this marriage.
What's this guru?
How can i conduct without you?
Why should i come the marriage that will never take place?
Sir, alakananda has escaped!
Where will you go?
Why are you beating me, dad?
I told you to bring her after killing badri, right?
I brought her after killing him.
How did you confirm is death?
I tested his breath, he's confirmly dead.
No, he's alive.
That's why she tried to escape.
Now i know why you've such a sway on this state!?
Though i don't want to call her as aunt, but i feel like calling you uncle.
You promised her to make me call her as aunt.
Badri too promised me something.
He promised to come and take me.
You could stop me from going but nobody can stop him from coming.
I'll stop him.
Till now 99 are dead in my account, he'll be my 100th victim.
I'll kill and bury him.
Do you know the most powerful thing on this earth?
You don't get tensed, i'll answer her.
Love!
- No, badri!
My badrinath!
Don't face his brawn and his courage.
You will die!
What the hell you're blabbering?
She never believed in god, why did you make her believe in god?
You gave her faith, that's why she's waiting for you.
She's in danger and she doesn't need mud to flowers.
Whether it is allah or shiva or jesus, any god would come to help in the form of human only.
If you don't go, she'll lose faith in badrinath.
Then, alakananda would die.
If you don't go, she'll lose faith in badrinath.
Then, alakananda would die.
He'll not go away from me, i can't live without him.
Sir! - Do it fast, temple will open day after tomorrow.
Do it fast. - Yes sir.
- Where is das?
Who are you guys?
Who are you?
Why are you creating havoc in my guru's absence?
Where is badri?
He has gone to andhra to bring alakananda.
He's just 10 minutes away from bellary.
Tell your men to escape!
If you face our fiery badri you'll be reduced to ashes.
Including your son!
What?
- Yes.
No enemy of us who entered bellary has ever returned alive from there.
Badri too mustn't come out alive.
Infact he mustn't enter bellary.
He has been beheaded!
If you stop it here, this will end with one head only.
If you step forward, heads will start rolling down.
I'm here to take a devotee to her god!
Don't stop me.
Is she incense stick to bridge between devotee and god?
His future wife.
I don't have patience or time to talk to you.
Don't stop divine work, you'd die.
How dare you warn me in my place!
Don't irritate me, step aside.
Hack him, boys!
Badri is here to take you!
Where are you going?
Go inside!
It's badrinath everywhere, whether i open or close my eyes... it's badrinath at dawn and when i wake up... badrinath fills my dreams, and my thoughts... it's badrinath in me... it's badrinath with me...
long live badrinath!
Badrinath is flamboyant swordsman... badrinath is death... badrinath is the lightning... badrinath is with you... badrinath is in you...
i'm always thinking of you...
i'll collect your sights like embers... i'll spend my life in that smoldering heat... play the drums boisterously...
i'll use your sari end like ladder to reach you... i'll come down like the drop of sweat from your forehead... you're my friend and you're my enemy... you're my love and you're my lover...
what's this music, master?
Another step please!
I'll seek your kisses as loan... i'll repay with interest of my love...
i'll reside in your heart... i'll give myself as rent... you're my wish, you're my sweet pain... you're my heaven and you're the hell i love...
what are you looking at guru?
It's not takshasila that been reduced to ashes but your faith in him.
The wounds may get healed, we can rebuild this takshasila.
But he took the weapon that's used only to protect god to save his lover.
Is it jaipur?
We need urgently 20 legs, 40 hands and 35 foots.
Like laila cyclone washed away the crops, a man came here and cut our men.
I'll sms the address, parcel the parts.
Sarcar, your home has become a hospital.
You were lucky to get saved.
If not you too would need jaipur leg or hand.
You always said to stay away from love, lest it may ruin us.
We got ruined now.
I'll hack you.
Don't touch him.
I was born to the richest father in this state.
Though i got proposals from the wealthiest families, you know why i chose and eloped with you?
Rowdyism always fascinated me from my childhood.
20 years ago you were ruling over student community, now you've risen to rule over this state, i told you to get my son married to her.
You couldn't do it.
But she made badri to beat him to death.
Badri must die before my son regains consciousness.
And alakananda must be at his feet.
Come!
Stop there!
You promised on badrinath and broke it.
Leave this holy place forever.
Who is he stop you?
Come on badri!
He's not just my guru, he's my god!
It's you who must have the glimpse of lamp and get the wish fulfilled.
You go... go...
it's me! It's me!
To unite badri with me, you've separated him from bheeshma narain again.
Are you happy?
- I am.
But not fully!
Little disappointed.
That disappointment would also go after you marry your lover.
Mad badri!
Do you know who is my lover?
Kill him and bring alakananda!
Stop!
I promised to bring her to have the glimpse of holy lamp and i did so.
It's you who killed people misunderstanding that i love her.
I don't love her or to say i'll not love any girl in this world.
I was born for my guru!
If you ask me to leave, i'll leave this world not just this holy place, guru.
How nice it would if disciple too had right to forgive!
This world runs on the wheels of faith.
I've lost to the faith.
You've won!
Go, have a glimpse!
Stop him!
Tell him not to make us believe that wishes would get fulfilled.
Badri, it was you i wished for!
Do you know who i love?
You!
What are you blabbering?
I'll kill you.
Just a minute.
Then do what ever you want to do with me.
Trusting the words of you like me, everything here is filled with lord vishnu, and mad people are flocking to this place, there's no god at all!
Not only in your badrinath, there's no god in this nature itself.
Don't believe it.
Don't make me believe it.
I'll die without you, badri... I'll die!
Please don't leave me... stop badri!
The girl's love for you is greater than your devotion towards god.
Any disciple can become my heir, but nobody can take the place of you in the girl's heart.
It's your responsibility to prove lord vishnu is omnipotent to her and millions here.
Go, get her!
No, please don't kill me.
No... please don't kill me.
I kill only for god and to protect law.
Never again try to see alakananda.
Don't know what new problem this old man would create now?
You're taking my life, you'll give birth in near future to a more brave and more powerful boy than him.
You must hand over him to me.
&gt;&gt;Cutts: Hey everybody. We're back for another round of Webmaster Videos.
 Let's use what we've learned about finding the minimums and maximums of functions to solve some optimization problems. And you might be wondering, Sal, what is an optimization problem.
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction. So 0.8... the 8 right over here is in the tenths place. So you can read this as 8 tenths and we can write that literally as being equal to 8 tenths or 8 over 10.
And now, we've already written it as a fraction and if we want we can simplify this down. We are not changing the value of the fraction because we are dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing 8 divided by 2 is 4, 10 divided by 2 is 5 and we're done.
0.8 is the same thing as 8 tenths, which is the same thing as 4 fifths.
About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health.
(Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases.
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.
(Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. We did this software which displays it like this: every bubble here is a country.
We have very good data since 1962 -- 1960 about -- on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years.
And 1962, there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives.
Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right?
And in the '90s, we have the terrible HlV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.
(Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.
1964. America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives.
And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
(Laughter)
And this won't work. (Applause) So what is needed?
So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, from the London Underground, where they warn you, "mind the gap." So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this.
Everyone says, "It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched.
(Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh?
(Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
This is the income distribution of China, 1970.
This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. And what has happened?
Almost like a ghost, isn't it? (Laughter) It's pretty scary.
I would guess that you are reasonably familiar with linear scales.
These are the scales that you would typically see in most of your math classes, and so just to make sure we know what we are talking about and maybe thinking about in a slightly different way let me draw a linear number line. Let me start with the zero and what we are going to do is we are gonna say:

The answer is that we select this path first--the one from Arad to Sibiu-- because it has the smallest value--393--of the sum f=g+h.
Welcome to the presentation on subtracting decimal numbers. Let's get started with some problems. The first problem I have here says five point seven three minus point zero eight two one equals who knows?
So we're ready to subtract. Ten minus six is four. Nine minus eight is one.
Hope I didn't confuse you too much. But I think you're ready now to try the subtraction of decimals. Have fun!

Lakshmi: So, my last question to you Kalki You are the future, young you know you're part of the INK fellow's program
All right, we're on problem number 8. They ask us which equation is equivalent 5x-2(7x+1)＝14x So I'm guessing they just want to simplify this a little bit and see if we get to one of these choices.
 Today's question comes from the Netherlands. p3sn asks, correct quotations in Google. How can you quote correctly from different sources without getting penalized for duplicated content?
And you talk about that, and you say why you agree or disagree-- a ton of great sites. Techdirt is a site that will include a little quote, but it will give its perspective,which is unique. And so those sorts of things are completely legitimate and absolutely fine.
In the last couple of videos we saw that we can describe a curves by a position vector-valued function. And in very general terms, it would be the x position as a function of time times the unit vector in the horizontal direction. Plus the y position as a function of time times the unit victor in the vertical direction.
And it's only applicable between t being greater than a and less than b.
If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.
(Audience whistles) Thank you very much.
(Applause) That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.
(Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.
(Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways.
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough. Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx. [Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too.
Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina.
You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to. (Laughter) So I don't have a problem with developers making money.
I was making him an offer.
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
(Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.
(Applause)
I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.

[Male narrator] The answer is that in Sibiu, the action function gives us 4 actions corresponding to traveling along these 4 roads, so we have to add in paths for each of those actions. One of those paths goes here, the other path continues from Arad and goes out here.
Now, it may seem silly and redundant to have a path that starts in Arad, goes to Sibiu and returns to Arad. How can that help us get to our destination in Bucharest? But we can see if we're dealing with a tree search, why it's natural to have this type of formulation and why the tree search doesn't even notice that it's backtracked.
What I want to do in this video is to expose you and introduce you to the idea to what a computer program is. And just in case you want to follow along I highly recommend you do that because the real way to learn computer science is to really fiddle with things yourself.
It's free. It's an open-source piece of software. And I'm using Python..Python...
As long as you are using Python 2 your examples will be the same as mine, they work the same way.
But If you're using Python 3 you are going to have to use slightly different variations every now and then to make it work properly. I'll try to make notes for those when they occur. So let's just start writing ourselves a computer program.
I was just looking on the discussion boards on the Khan Academy Facebook page, and Bud Denny put up this problem, asking for it to be solved. And it seems like a problem of general interest.
[PROBLEM SOLVlNG]
In this unit we're going to talk about problem solving. The theory and technology of building agents that can plan ahead to solve problems. In particular, we're talking about problem solving where the complexity of the problem comes from the idea that there are many states.
The question is, is there a solution that the agent can come up with given the knowledge shown here to the problem of driving from Arad to Bucharest?
And the answer is no. There is no solution that the agent can come up with because Bucharest doesn't appear on the map, and so the agent doesn't know any actions that can arrive there. So let's give the agent a better chance.
[DEFlNITlON OF A PROBLEM]
Now let's formally define what a problem looks like. A problem can be broken down into a number of components. First, the initial state that the agent starts out with.
[ACTlONS (s) ]
In some problems, the agent will have the same actions available in all states and in other problems, he'll have different actions dependent on the state. In the route finding problem, the actions are dependent on the state. When we're in one city, we can take the routes to the neighboring cities-- but we can't go to any other cities.
The Step Cost function takes a state, an action, and the resulting state from that action and returns a number--n--which is the cost of that action. In the route finding example, the cost might be the number of miles traveled or maybe the number of minutes it takes to get to that destination.
So what's interest? We all have heard of it. Interest rates, or interest on your mortgage, or how much interest do I owe on my credit card.
One year. And this is you, and this is me. So now you give me $100.
Right? And that $200 is equal to $100 of principal, plus $100 of interest, because I paid $10 a year of interest. And this notion which I just did here, this is actually called simple interest.
Let's go ahead and expand this node now. So we're going to add 3 paths. This one has a path cost of 291 and an estimated distance to the goal of 380, for a total of 671.
They're burying it in their backyards.
That "money" is doing nothing. They've provided some goods and services to someone else.
I have no claims on any goods and resources, but I have an idea.
I could give these coins to these people, they would dig the irrigation ditch and then I could charge people the service of using my-- or maybe I'll charge people access to water and then I could essentially generate a return. But how do I do that? Well, what if I could borrow some of these people, right?
And so what is a bank going to do? What is my bank going to do?
How am I going to start my business? I'm actually one of these entrepreneurs.
Let me draw my balance sheet.
So that's my balance sheet. Let's say my initial balance sheet is-- I put in a million dollars of my gold coins.
So I'll actually draw the building. It has pillars in the front. It looks like an old Greek or Roman temple.
So everyone puts their savings with me. And let's say that is that is $10 million of savings in my village. I have a fairly wealthy village.
This is a liability for me, right? Why is it a liability? Because I owe that to other people.
This is my building. I'm running a business here, right? I'm not doing this as some type of nonprofit or charity work.
That's an asset, right? I give that money to someone else. They owe me $9 million.
So the natural question is, how am I making money? Well, these loans-- I'm hopefully putting them to build irrigation ditches or build factories or do whatever, something that actually is an investment, that creates more value than it needed to start up.
So what is that? That's $900,000 a year I'm bringing in.
So interest income-- $900,000. Interest expense-- $500,000. That nets me $400,000.
And everyone benefits. The pie's getting bigger because these are real investments that are going to benefit my village. And of course, these people benefit because they get safekeeping for their accounts and their money is actually growing.
Anyway, see you in the next video.
Now we see how to modify the Tree Search Function to make it be a Graph Search Function to avoid those repeated paths. What we do, is we start off and initialize a set called the explored set of states that we have already explored. Then, when we consider a new path, we add the new state to the set of already explored states, and then when we are expanding the path and adding in new states to the end of it, we don't add that in if we have already seen that new state in either the frontier or the explored.
Arad is crossed off the list.
The path that goes from Arad to Sibiu and back to Arad is removed, and we are left with these one, two, three, four, five possible paths. Given these 5 paths, show me which ones are candidates to be expanded next by the Breadth First Search Algorithm.
The answer is that soup occurs in most of these phrases but not 100% of them. It's missing in this phrase. Equivalently, on the Chinese side we see this character occurs in most of the phrases, but it's missing here.
Welcome to our programming tutorials on Khan Academy. Are you completely new to computer programming? Well, don't worry--that means that you're like 99.5% of the world.
We're on problem 66. And it says what is x squared minus 4x plus 4, divided by x squared minus 3x plus 2, reduced to lowest terms? So they probably want us to factor each of these quadratics and see if any of these terms cancel out.
Minus 2 and minus 2 is minus 4.
Minus 2 squared is plus 4. So this is x minus 2 times x minus 2. And you could test it if you don't believe it.
Minus 2 times minus 1 is positive 2.
Minus 2 plus minus 1 is minus 3. So x minus 2, times x minus 1. And if we assume that x is never equal to 2, because that would make this expression undefined, we cancel that out.
I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. And some of you may argue, "Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?"
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?" Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. (Laughter) If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated. (Laughter) You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about.
(Laughter) As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this. (Applause and cheering) (Applause ends)
Thank you. (Applause)
當我27歲時， 辭去一份很費心血的諮詢工作， 接受了更辛苦的工作，教書。 我教７年級數學 在紐約市中心的學校 也像其他老師一樣出考試和小考 我給回家功課 作業交回後，我批改並打成績 Ａ Ｂ
So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces. Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. Hit me.
What I want to do in this video is one, just do a bunch of addition examples so that we really get some good practice and we really get warmed up with addition.
And what I even more want to show you is that we now have all the tools we need to really tackle any addition problem. So let's just get warmed up with some one-digit addition problems, but these are the ones that always give me a
Let's start with a really, relatively straightforward one.
I want to say two plus four. Well, we know what that is. I don't think we need to draw the number line at this point, but you can if you need to remember this.
Two plus four is six. Not too bad.
What about nine plus three? We saw that in the last video. Nine plus one is ten.
Nine plus three is twelve. And it's probably not a bad idea.

Three!
Just in three minutes... continuously...shouldn't miss one...
lf any man does it, I, Nisha will give him lip to lip kiss.
lsn't there any man here to get kissed?
Kiss is planted with love.
Kiss won't generate love.
We both don't know when and how the magic of love strikes us.
Hail Lord Shiva!
World is full of love...
You're free to fall in love...
You're the one to tie the auspicious Knot...
You're a form of love...
My character is to love...
Start loving from birth...
live the entire life in love...
Love is a challenge...
losing to win is great...
Love is our philosophy...
love is our doctrine...
If love is your beginning and end...
love is non-duality....
Please don't mind, I'll take your plate.
Look at this friends!
Looks like an ad!
Had I got this idea, I'd have written 'I love you' on idly with tomato sauce.
I would've poured sambar on it.
Fancy number.
ls it you?
Cinema?
Pub?
Dinner?
Love?
Thanks for your choice.
lf you send number like this, it's like call taxi or call g...
The feeling you got on seeing me,
I must also get the same feeling on seeing you.
It's love only we both get the same feeling at the same time.
I need to talk to you urgently.
Who is this time?
Hey Swetha?
You and he...
Yes Sandy, Abhiram has made marriage arrangements tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning?
- Yes, we need all your support
Routine problem.
Don't you've any other solution?
This is not routine problem, Swetha's dad is the Home Minister.
Moreover he's encounter specialist.
Swetha's marriage and our death will happen at a time.
That's the real point of interest.
Why are you guys worrying?
It's my plan and I'm taking the risk.
What's in love?
Any fool can fall in love.
I mean you must have guts to go against everyone and marry them off.
All I've is guts.
Tell me!
Surprized, why you haven't yet named me?
Nothing much, just hide Swetha and Uday in your home tonight, that's all.
Home Minister is your family friend, so he'll not suspect you.
Will it work out?
Just now reached Sandy's house.
Going to a party at Srinath uncle's place, why not join us?
No way!
He'll kill with the old tale of his making it big time.
I can't tolerate it.
- Okay, I asked you just like that.
They are safe, let's go.
Tomorrow morning at 6 am, Sandy.
You guys don't get out of bed by 10 am also, what are you planning to do at 6 am?
Anyway he'll not get a job, he has decided to watch birds.
Shall we go?
I've a small suggestion for you.
- What?
Looks like your sleeve is getting smaller with passing time.
I'll listen if my husband tells, not you.
Gopi couldn't tell you directly and sought my help to tell you.
ls it true, Gopi?- What's this?
- ls it true?
He's creating unnecessary trouble and you believe him!
He'll...
How you've raised your son?
- You raised him.
Why are you so worried?
It's me!
She left her home for me, can't you get it?
How much my dad will get tensed and shake up the entire state?
Mere thought of it is giving me jitters.
Don't get tensed, everything will go on smoothly.
Be careful.
Did you find the man who cut a girl's throat for not acknowledging his love?
Found him sir.
But died in an encounter...
He died!
That's all?
- Yes sir.
I'm worried about repercussions.
We are in trouble if we fail to find him or if he's killed.
Don't spare such rogues under any circumstances.
Entire state's youth must wet their pants on hearing about love.
Got me?
Come in Sandeep!
When did you come?
I didn't see you.
It seems you got a job in America.
Your dad told me, please take your seat.
It's cool to celebrate, have a drink.
That's respect!
That's why I like you so much.
Where is Swetha?
Didn't she come with you?
Swetha will never come home.
What did you say?
Can we go in and talk personally?
No problem, carry on.
Swetha has eloped with my friend Uday.
What the hell are you saying, bloody?
You know who I am, right?
Where is Swetha?
Tell me!
Swetha is with Uday, uncle.
lf I book you under any case, your career is finished.
I know that very well, that's why I came to you, uncle.
As a father your anger and hurt is justified.
As the Home Minister, you can find Swetha using your network.
You'll get her married again even if she's married.
You'll have Uday get killed in some encounter.
Am I right?
- You're right.
Doesn't your friend has this common sense?
Go and tell him about my power and reach.
Before I tell them about your power, you must know their love power.
What should I know about it newly?
No need to use your intelligence department to find Swetha and Uday.
Just use your intelligence to know who is Uday, that's enough.
You've crossed our age, just go back again and think.
Have you come here to give me a ride on time machine?
I'll kill you, bloody!
You can anything born on this earth, but one can never kill love, not just men even God can't kill it.
Where is Sandy?
Still under rugs?
Didn't turn up from last night?
That's worrying me.
Look, Sandy is here.
Why did you come so late?
He has brought a car too.
Are you the conductor of this marriage?
- Sir...me...
God, for himself...
Shastry, check book if you don't know, don't recite wrongly.
Am I reciting wrongly?
Today's youth can't read or write Telugu.
They have ruined the language.
He's here to tell about Bhagavath Gita.
My second language was Sanskrit.
That's the matter.
It isn't pronounced like that, but like this.
That's like my grandson!
Have you taken today's medicine dose, grandma?
Oh no!
Of late you're becoming old absent minded professor.
I've to remind you everything.
Get up!
Take it!
Look at this photo.
- How about this one?
There are two girls in this.
Will he like her?
Why are you looking at photos early morning?
To select a photo for the poster, right?
Why are you taking sudden interest in my publicity?
Who amongst them is very close to you?
Close?
lf I get close to one, others will unite to kill me.
That's why I'm very close with all of them.
lsn't it difficult with whole bunch?
You must be close with only one.
How can he understand if you say like that?
Nothing son, you're going to America next month, joining work there, am I on right track?
you'll not come back in next 5 years, so, we're thinking of your marriage.
Fine!
I'm ready to marry.
I thought it'll be very difficult to get his acceptance.
I never expected he'll agree so easily.
I'll also get bored to live alone in America.
Tell me who amongst them is your girl friend, we'll talk to her parents.
- Yes, we will.
See!
That's why this photo exhibition.
They all are just friends.
I don't have any lover or girl friend.
What?
Haven't you fallen in love yet?
How will you marry then?
ls it international problem?
You select a bride for me, I'll marry her.
Will you go for an arranged marriage instead of love marriage?
There's something fishy in it.
He's always in pubs and parties, how can he be without a girl friend?
Something is not right.
Going to pubs don't mean I must have girl friends.
Don't I want a girl friend?
I haven't met a girl who could make me skip a beat.
So I've decided to marry the girl of your choice.
To which bygone era do you belong?
30 years ago I and your dad fell in love, eloped to marry.
Born in fast generation, will you go for an arranged marriage?
ls arranged marriage taboo for the fast generation?
Why?
You want to curse us all your life.
Vasu, you remember, last year I bought a shirt for his birthday, he threw it on my face, when he didn't like my surprize gift, will he like my selected lifetime gift?
You're right, you don't know about latest fashion, don't know about latest trends, shirts or cell phones can be exchanged or left unused, but life partner isn't like that, must be very careful while selecting,
I fear of selection going wrong in tension, so I'm leaving that responsibility on you both.
By any chance are we responsible for refusing love marriage?
What's your opinion about our married life?
I think I was in eight class, one night you threw a chapatti on mother's face for not in round shape, mummy wasn't any less, she hit you back with a spatula.
It lead to big trouble.
You showed me lraq war in home.
That night sister Sindhu and I never slept.
We entered hall next morning fearing terrible but...
The scene was completely different.
Both were happily talking to each other as if nothing had happened last night.
Still I can't understand how you both compromised that night.
Apart from those little arguments,
I haven't seen any couple more understanding than you.
I too want to be like you.
What happened to you then?
We expected you will bring a princess, but you've left the responsibility of finding a bride on us.
You played some trick and trapped mom.
You got lucky, crow.
Anyway I'm not as talented as you are, Gopi.
lf Vasu had brothers like me then, you would've got the stick.
Why not now?
You come to beat me for eloping with your mother.
I did what I ought to then, that's why you're here now.
Who are you guys?
Why are you standing there only?
My boss won't step out until inauspicious time elapses.
lnauspicious time has elapsed!
Who are you?
Hey granny!
When are you kicking the bucket?- What?
I mean when will you die, what's the doctor's opinion?
I'll die in near future, I want to see my grandson's marriage before it, have you made a request like that?
You've guessed it right, boss.
It's all experience.
I can judge by reading the faces.
It's my responsibility to ensure marriage and your death happen at right time.
What the hell are you saying?
I'll break your teeth.
lf you want take a month or two or even a year's time, but don't use abusive language.
Who is this idiot?
- Marriage fixer Dilip Raja.
Who is the groom?
This young chap?
Over age no problem, I'll manage.
- No, this old man's son.
By any chance is the groom like him?
My commission will go up.
No, my son is very handsome.
- So, he's after you, since you say he's handsome, let's find a world beauty for him.
Your experience?
- Over 10000 marriages, want to complete a lakh in 5 years and enter Guinness Book Of Records.
Please give me that.
I think you're more interested in this than records.
By the way, are you married?
When I was about to marry...
- My boss is true professional.
On getting better commission, he got her married to another man.
Give them more details.
I got it.
Madam's breakfast is worst.
You want your son to marry and eat good food cooked by daughter-in-law, right?
We want a daughter-in-law, not a cook.
I tested your psychology about marriage attitudes.
Please little upma.
Quick marriage?
- You don't know what it is?
Meeting on internet, get engaged using webcam, marry in a flight, I mean marrying in sky!
Press, TV publicity free.
Marriage in sky?
You don't like it, then go for marriage in water.
Bay of Bengal?
Pacific ocean?
Musi river?
What are you saying?
Marriage in water?
I think you don't like that too,
how about marriage in cemetery?
Not just marrying in the witness of fire but dead souls too.
You've an advantage too.
You don't have to fear about wife or future.
We'll tell the place of marriage, just show us the girls.
lf you're so clear about it, I'll show you good proposals.
Those girls?
That's why, I never show the photos to groom's parents.
Show it to the groom only.
Will you set a marriage in one hour?
How much time to disconnect?
He asked about disconnection before connection.
That will take less than half an hour.
My brother is separation specialist.
He gives 25% discount to my clients.
I liked your five basic elements concept.
Air, water, fire, earth, what's your choice?
You decide it.
- Why should I decide?
You decide in which element you'll become a part of it.
Why should I become part of it?
So, no one to shed a tear also.
So, I can kill you immediately.
Mother...just a minute.
Both of you please come here.
No problem if you're late to office, please come here.
Tell me...
First you relax.
What's this mom?
ls this the way to find a bride?
When I could browse internet and find a job, can't I chat and find a bride for myself?
This is not right.
Go personally and find a bride for me.
Birth or death isn't in our hands, marriage is the only occasion we choose ourselves, we mustn't miss the happiness and festivities accompanying it.
What we couldn't give to our parents 30 years ago, he has given us an opportunity, we must keep his trust.
I've seen love failures taking to drinks, why are you drinking after marriage?
Not only him, I too want to drink.
When you both had same tastes before marriage, I was surprized, is it this one?
What happened?
- We don't have any problem. It's you!
Do you know what he's doing?
He has almost stopped drinking, right?
Shut up!
Sandy is going for an arranged marriage!
Bloody!
It's my marriage.
Why are you guys shocked?
We had great expectations on your love marriage, that you will elope with CM or PM's daughter, bomb blasts and hot chases,
I had great plans for your marriage.
So many girls are swooning over you, why are you going for an arranged marriage?
You'll not know what you're missing is the thrill of love.
Love is not a thrill but a great feeling.
Don't shut me up.
ln my opinion when two people like each other at the same time, it's love.
ls it any accident when two vehicles hit at the same time?
First you like someone, it will turn into love later.
Yuck! I can't fall in love for the sake of love.
I must get that feeling.
When I see a beautiful girl, I feel just a wow!
I don't get the feel, love!
You know the advantages of love marriage?
You'll know what your wife likes before itself.
Wife can know what food husband likes before itself.
Family background and bank balances will be clear.
It's not in arranged marriages.
Will you be happy with it?
Correct! I never thought in this angle.
I may be wrong in deciding this.
Your parents' marriage is love marriage, right?- No.
Your parents?
- No.
Arranged?
How can there be understanding between your parents then?
Aren't they fighting each other everyday?
Aren't their lives full of problems?
Tell me.
Can't you understand after seeing us?
That they are very happy.
That's it.
Can't you understand how successful my parents' love marriage is after seeing me?
Not only that my sister's too is love marriage.
So, I respect and like love marriages more than you all.
Whether it's arranged or love marriage, there are bound to be some failures.
Problem isn't in the marriage.
It's in understanding each other and finding true love.
Then, why don't you fall in love?
- Don't I want to fall in love?
Till now I never had that magic feeling.
So, I left the choice to my parents who understand me best.
But till now you said you'll do anything for love.
I still stand by my word, I'll do anything for love.
lf I fall in love, I'll go to any extent for my love.
Sister, please show me.
After great difficulty we selected a girl for you,
Sister, give it to me.
- Will you say okay seeing the photo?
Catch me.
- Sister, please....stop.
Brother-in-law, tell her.
You too brother-in-law.
Sister, stop.
Show me.
Let him see it.
- So easily?
Mother, you tell her.
On one condition, if your brother-in-law gets promotion, you must walk to Tirumala and tonsure your head.
Okay?
I'm ready to marry, won't I be ready for a tonsure?
First show me the photo.
Are you ready sacrifice hair to see your future wife's photo?
I can't you shaven head, see this.
Take it.
Take it.
Sit here.
What if I don't see the photo?
What if I don't see the photo?
I can see her face only, right?
I'm sure you would've selected a good girl.
What are you saying?
Won't you see her photo?
Son, I beg you, you're shocking us continuously.
Please take a look at the girl's photo.
See!
I beg you, please don't raise our tension.
Take look at her!
- Look!
Grandma!
According to tradition when should a groom see the bride?
According to tradition, my grandfather saw my grandmother in marriage canopy.
Fantastic idea!
I'll also see her there only.
This is more thrilling than love marriage.
I'm sure he's gone crazy.
He's gone crazy.
My marriage should also happen like the one in this photograph.
What?
Like my grandmother's marriage?
You're asking a marriage that was celebrated 100 years ago.
It was a 16 day long marriage festivities!
ln that marriage was 5 days affair.
- 5 days!
Grandma's marriage!
A big marriage canopy!
A vast pedestal!
Brothers...sisters!
Aunts...uncles!
Paternal aunts...maternal uncles!
It used be a grand spectacle!
5 days marriage?
Mummy, my marriage also must be like that.
5 days?
Can relatives stay for so long?
Why not?
Can't our relatives do this for us?
Just one is quite difficult, 5 days is practically impossible.
I'll put a ring to some girl in America and kiss her.
Marriage will be over in seconds.
- No please.
Let's go for 5 day marriage as you wish.
lf not he'll kiss an American girl.
I didn't understand when he turned cross while delivering him, though he's grown up, he's still like that only.
Grandpa!
- So, you're learning to be a householder.
This is my childhood style.
lf any guests come I used to give water to wash legs.
You're also doing the same.
Little bit trendy now.
ls it?
Welcome, brother and sister-in-law.
Though nearing a century, you're still very strong.
What's the secret of your health?
My grandson gives me medicine three times a day.
That's the secret.
- Medicine?
What's that?
Give us also.
You too want it?
- Here it is!
This is it!
Thank God!
You've come!
Father-in-law.
- Are you fine, dear?
Welcome, uncle.
- Can't bear him anymore, aunt?
He wants every relative must attend the marriage.
I don't know how I'll manage it.
Why are you so adamant?
I've given her all the addresses I know.
They are running around.
lnfact I got married taking half day leave from office.
Would anyone go to attend someone else's marriage taking a week off?
I don't care about all that, I'll marry only everyone makes to it.
lf not I'll cancel it.
Sister! It seems it's a 16 day marriage festivities!
Yes, actual marriage is 5 day long in it.
Yes, marriage canopy is amidst green fields.- Granny!
It seems we all must go in the same dress.
Greetings.
Keep the bags inside.
Welcome!
Are you fine?
Greetings....
Very happy...very very happy...
I expected you'll go at jet speed like Allu Arjun,
I didn't expect you'll plan systematically like Allu Ramalingaiah.
My friend too tell the same thing.
Why youth like you is going backwards in time?
It's not going back, it's bringing back the olden times.
To say it in simple term, recycle!
Where life begins, after some time it must reach the starting point.
Granny, have cool drink.
You didn't have anything since afternoon.
You're very caring about me.
First day chief guest, second day ordinary guest, third day unwanted guest, I expected such a treatment.
Did you've such bad idea about us?
You too have little.
I expected you'll show differences between relatives of husband side &amp; wife side.
But Vasundhara looks after everyone equally.
Were you having such cheap idea about us?
Don't worry, just playing with you.
Look!
- ls it?
Yenki's marriage cost dear to Subbi.
- This is it.
ln the name of your marriage, your aunt made me shell out Rs.25000.
You'll anything whatever your tongue wags.
Table full of tasteless food and love less husband are of no use.
I married him because he's aunt's son.
What we eat daily is any special, is aunt's son a husband?
Like old husband even on festival day.
Hear this one.
Long back a maiden,
I thought 'Garbhadanam' means eating something not this torture.
Another man when he was called to bedroom for the first night, said, he has got no time and use someone else as standby and finish it.
Out sourcing?
There was his brother, he was asked to say something good.
He asked, where's the bride widow?
When asked by sister-in-law to come to romance her.
Brother-in-law asked, what benefit would I get?
I never said like that.
- Why would you say like that?
You'll say it's not proper to romance aunt daughter.
Stubborn husband will cry if I pinch also.
Don't use the occasion to pinch me.
I know only this proverb, please don't mind.
This is what you call pinching the child and then rocking the cradle.
Did you say about my wife or a proverb?
Proverbs come from our lives only.
lf you see Arundhati star in marriage, you'll not get such doubts.
Where did he see Arundhati?
When asked have you seen Arundhati?
It seems he said I didn't see but saw Rs.6000 loan.
I was lucky in this matter, uncle.
I could see only Rs.25000.
Even that Rs.25000 was my dad's.
Marriage homes must be happy and filled with laughter.
Will gossip fill our stomachs?
Let's hit the dinner table.
Everything is ready.
Why haven't mom and dad returned from the bride's place?
They will come.
- Children, come.
Hey groom!
Just got a call that your visa is ready.
Tie the knot and leave to America.
Sister, don't worry, mom and dad are back.
What's this?
- What?
Everything is turning like this.
- What happened?
You said you'll not see the bride.
We went to show your photo to the bride.
What happened?
Didn't she like my face?
Go ahead, I'm not that handsome anyway.
We told her that you'll marry without seeing her photo also.
She said she'll not see your photo and wish to see you in marriage canopy only.
My type!
Perfect match!
Don't know what's in store for the future!
Till now he was alone, now another is joining him.
Such a type of girl in these times, very strange.
It's strange all the way.
Yours is love marriage and your son's is arranged marriage, bride and groom agreeing to marry without seeing each other, it's strange all the way.
Where's the bride's photo?
Will you atleast show her to us?
No way!
My son is cool, why are you so itching to see her?
Along with him all of you must see her in marriage only.
That's will add great thrill to the marriage.

Grandpa...grandpa...are betel leaves ready?
Where is it?
It's needed here urgently, get it fast.
Chanting these hymns, tie this grass around the bride's waist.
What's that?
You know 'Bhagavath Gita' so well, can't you chant a Sanskrit hymn?
It was second language, so I learnt only one to pass.
It's symbolic gesture to tell you must be my partner in all the good I do.
'Bondage of sharing equally'
Sanskrit isn't my second language, after knowing it's 5 day marriage, it was interesting, so I collected all the information.
That's all.
Please introduce her to us.
They are my close...waste friends.
No, not us, introduce bride's friends to us.
Definitely, first their husbands and then my friends.
Like groom like bride!
Didn't I say they are perfect match?
Sandy cuts our dialogues, she's much ahead cutting our tails.
Did you expect to get such a beautiful bride?
Brother-in-law is more handsome than my sister.
Where is Sandeep?
Brother-in-law!
Be careful! ls everyone safe?
Check if Deepthi is inside.
- Check carefully.
She's not here.
It seems not inside.
- She's not outside also.
She must be inside only.
Forget her!
Forget her!
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Where is Sandeep?
- There!
We traced the lnnova with 9999 number plate, it's a fake number.
We've shown state wide criminals photos to Sandeep.
He said he isn't in that list.
They have abducted her before marriage, they could be your enemies too.
- My enemies?
Bride's parents, he's Commissioner.
Had any trouble with any youth who was after your daughter?
Sorry, I didn't mean like that.
I thought it was better to investigate from all angles.
Nothing like that, not because she's my daughter, Deepthi is an angel.
Her only concentration was on studies.
lf it was for ransom, we would've got a phone call by now.
We didn't get it, it means it's more dangerous.
But this doesn't look like a regular criminal's handiwork.
Somebody has planned it well to look like an accident.
Luckily no life was lost.
You must solve this problem, Sandeep must go to America next week.
Come.
Don't know what went wrong, marriage got stopped midway.
The sacrificial fire must burn for entire 16 days non-stop.
Marriage is stopped, do we need to keep the sacrificial fire burning?
Don't say it, it's wrong, already a bad thing has happened, if sacrificial fire is put off midway, it's bad omen.
Don't say like that.
Look, any great achievement will face many obstacles, as many obstacles you face so great will be your achievement.
ls it travel agency?
Where is the blue bag?
- I don't know, find yourself.
Confirm Sandeep's ticket, cancel the ticket on Deepthi and return the passport.
That ticket is cancelled.
Greetings Commissioner.
Any trace of my daughter?
We've solved many complicated cases in hours.
No progress in the case even after a week.
Sir you are...
We've studied psychos and criminals list, someone is very strong against this marriage, unable to trace out where he has taken her and what he may've done?
We suspect if she's alive.
Sandeep is going to America tomorrow, we came to meet him.
We'll inform you immediately on getting any clue.
Calm down...please calm down.
Be brave.
Police have given up, it's better we too give up.
Please don't mistake me for saying this,
Deepthi is also like my granddaughter, if she goes missing, what can anyone do?
Why not get that quick marriage broker and get Sandeep married before he leaves?
You said what I thought.
It's marriage only after one ties the knot.
Even it one tied the knot, legally they must walk the holy seven steps together.
It isn't a marriage and the missing girl isn't your wife.
First let him go to America and get out of it.
Our bad luck mustn't affect your son's life.
How long can you wait for my daughter nobody knows if she's alive or not?
Hubby!
We did arrange a grand marriage, but got stopped before tying the knot.
It means they weren't married.
We don't have any objection if you fix another marriage for your son.- Okay.
What the hell are you saying?
ls it marriage only if I tie the knot?
Are the rituals before it nothing?
You gave her in marriage to me, I accepted, has it got no meaning?
You made us place jaggery and cumin seeds on head.
Was it a dolls play?
Nobody knows the meaning of Deepthi's look on removing the screen, is it you my friend for whom I was waiting till now, a happiness, a surprize, she conveyed through her eyes, I'll surrender my life to you.
Till now magic of love never touched me.
That magic of love feeling...
I felt on Deepthi at the first sight.
Sister, you said you got the same feeling in library.
You vowed to leave with him going against parents.
I never understood the power of first look.
Uday, you said about love at first sight, when we ragged Swetha.
I used to think how could one fall in love at first sight.
But I can understand now, that magic one moment which can bring two hearts together for lifetime, you had it in library, for you while ragging, for me under the marriage canopy,
I fell in love with Deepthi at first sight.
Whether tradition or law accepts or not, Deepthi is wife.
Whether I tie knot with her or not...
Hearing their words I'm scared if sister is alive or not.
But hearing your words I feel she's alive.
Like in fables you read, I'll bring your sister even if she's beyond seven seas.
Well said grandson!
When you chose traditional marriage, I thought you were doing it for fun,
love sprouted from that tradition, and you're so responsible for that love,
I came to know just now.
What you said a little while ago is true, placing jaggery and cumin seeds isn't child's play, it isn't fun too, when you mix jaggery and cumin seeds, it's energy, a magnetic force is produced from that energy, it produces magnetic force!
Likewise an attraction develops between wife and husband.
What our science says?
The divine spiritual energy enters from here, it's always closed, when jaggery and cumin seeds are placed here, it opens up, spiritual energy above will reach the centre of forehead here, when they see each other, each other's energy will merge into one, that's first sight, that what we call magic of love!
It's love which unites two hearts forever.
You will come victorious!
You will live your wife.
The vows you made, they will protect you.
Forget her!
Forget her!
Till now didn't find any trace about the girl?
What is your department doing?
ls it working or sleeping?
What are you trying?
To find ways to close this case.
You may say some psycho killed her and didn't find body also.
That's all, okay?
I know your working style.
Governments change but police are the same always.
Going over speed, slow down.
When my daughter went missing, Sandeep informed her whereabouts.
Not the police.
His future wife is missing and I'm unable to help him.
I must help him, mustn't l?
Where is Sandeep?
It's been 3 days since he has come home.
He gave up job in America for Deepthi.
Poor boy!
He mustn't get into trouble going in search of her.
Nothing will happen to him, he saw her for just a moment only,
but has fallen in love so deeply,
Sandeep will come back with Deepthi only.
Why are you here on roads instead of in America with new wife?
What did you say?
5 day marriage!
On which day it got stopped?
Noodles mustn't boil for more than two minutes, three knots of marriage mustn't take more than 3 minutes.
lf you go on road, it'll be traffic jam, ogle the girl in next car, marry her in the parking lot, if you go to watch a film, love the girl sitting next to you, tie the knot during interval, make love before the end card appears.
I mean...
lf people can't go to marriage, take marriage to them.
That's it.
That's why I found a way for people like you.
I'm fixing marriages in college itself, collect details, if it's okay, fix marriage in college bus.
Follow me, you'll have great future.
What is he doing?
I think he's planning to bump you off.
Why a plan to kill me?
Just a punch can do it.
Your level is very low, so arranging separately.
Just missed the candidate, come immediately. I'll tell you.
What were and how you've become?
I can't see you in this condition.
ls it necessary to risk your life?
Let's go back to Hyderabad.
Don't know when and how you'll get attacked...
Let anything may come.
I too want that to happen.
They must come out atleast to kill me.
That's enough to know the whereabouts of Deepthi.
You don't know where is she, where will you start searching?
You all go back but leave the bike for me.
Please come back with Deepthi, she mustn't miss you.
This is not a dream...our meeting is real and our love is true...
I'll fight the world I see and go against the time which I don't ...
Though you are not with me, I'm in you...
I'll secure you liKe the eyelid protects the eye...
I'm with you always...
I'm liKe your shadow...
I'll become your partner at the horizon where earth and sKy meet...
O my dear, you're wish and boon...
I want your companionship...
O my dear, give life to my love...
What am I to do alone in this world?
My love for you is forever and hold the flame come whatsoever may...
O my dear, I'm ready to give my life to get you...
Chasing the lightning liKe clouds...
My heart is all charged up...
I lost you in the last minute...
Why did you vanish into thin air?
I've dared to challenge this world for you...
I'll maKe this world open the doors and unite with you at any cost...
Why don't we know her?
She changed bus here to reach town daily.
Golden angel.
She forced us to send our daughter to school instead of making her work.
Sister is very good lady, she presented this rose plant to me.
For attending school regularly.
Bye mother!
Don't know what difficulty she's facing, she had married without seeing the groom,
There's an Anganwadi teacher in next village near the temple, teacher and Deepthi used to travel together to the town
You may get any information from her.
By the way, who are you sir?
Police?
The man whom your golden angel married without seeing.
Got scared!
lf you don't listen to me, I'll throw acid on you.
I'll throw acid!
Scared?
Remove hands!
Got scared?
Leave me.
- Remove hands.
Got scared?
Remove hands.
Look...look here!
Got scared?
Tell me!
Remove your hands.
Please don't harm me.
Remove hands...got scared?
Will you throw acid on her?
You go! I'll take care of him.
How dare you tease girls?
Are girls so cheap to you?
Will you throw acid on her?
lnfact those girls must throw acid on rogues like you.
Even encounter death to rogues like you is justified.
Are you new to this area?
How dare you attack me!
Move!
Move!
Sir, the girl who was here just now...
- Anganwadi teacher?
Went home just now.
Anganwadi teacher?
Where is her home?
- Near that temple.
Madam, Anganwadi teacher's house...?
- This one only.
Don't know what had happened, just now police came and took her.
Daddy, call the Commissioner immediately....
Sandy is here!
- How are you my brother?
How are you my son?
- Got any information?
Your information is correct, I think teacher knows about Deepthi.
You traced her out before us.
We tried to get information before you but she's tight lipped.
I'm sure she has some information.
Actually we should...
I'm an Ogre, devotee of Satan.
Will you deny eternity to me for not having heavenly ambrosia?
Even Gods who had ambrosia will meet end in the great storm.
But Lord Shiva who has taken the poison will defy death.
Enemy of the death!
Lord Shiva is eternal!
Team DG
lf a man with poison in neck can become eternal, why shouldn't I be?
Every cell in me is filled with poison.
lsn't that qualification enough for me?
Goddess Abhisarani!
Goddess Sharvani!
Goddess of Mantra and Tantra!
Devil, she-devil, ghost, demon, elf, fiend, monster, Ogre, Satan!
Evil powers!
Announce to the world, I'm eternal!
Evil power!
I don't have death!
I don't have death!
I don't have death!
They stopped the bus for this play, you got me into this.
How much more time will it last?
Already we are very late.
I think bus will not start even after the play is over.
People are mesmerized.
People at home will be tensed if I'm late.
MLA Kondaraju will honour Diwakar on the stage.
He will honour!
You mustn't do the honour, it must be done by that girl!
Let's go and sit in the bus, come.
Anybody can act but only Diwakar can put life into those characters.
He's overdoing everything.
- Who is he?
He behaves like a psycho and none to beat him negative characters.
Yes, indeed he's going overboard in everything.
He wanted to get honoured by you, how dare you refuse!
You've committed a mistake.
Where ever he plays a drama, you must attend and honour him.
Follow him.
- lsn't it, brother?- Come here.
Wrong, don't talk like that.
Deal women smoothly.
She didn't like my acting, so she didn't honour me.
Tell me...why didn't you like it?
Tell me, who I am?
True! I myself don't know who am l?
Some say I'm a Mayala Maratee, some say I'm Sangram Singh,
Duryodhana, Betala, Keechaka, they call me by many names, till now I was slave to those roles, now...just a while ago, I came to know who I am.
That too because of you.
Man...l'm a man!
I'm totally fallen for you.
Engine has heated up.
I want to drive holding the steering.
What a figure!
What a pride!
You didn't like my acting.
But as a man I'll satisfy your urges.
Tonight let's satisfy our urges.
Nothing will happen if you don't go to home for a night.
Don't do it for free.
Take anything you want.
Just one night!
Evil power!
I won over death, I thought there's nothing to win over in this world.
There is evil power...there is...
Woman!
I must win over her!
I wanted her for just one night only.
No, that's not enough now.
This evil Ogre desires a woman and has fallen in love.
As many nights she has in her life, I want every one of it for myself.
My strength and her pride are perfect match, evil power!
Love at first sight is routine, love at first slipper shot is variety.
It's not love but birth of a new character.
Though he has come out of the stage, Kapalika is still hanging on to him.
Don't know what will he do now.
What? ls it sultry?
From now onwards only AC buses must ply on this route.
Don't do it for one night, we have many nights in future, go, drop them.
We thought he'll get sense if hit with a slipper, we never expected he'll go to this length.
Till now we didn't knew him, now that we know let's get him, sir.
We couldn't do anything till now because we didn't knew about Deepthi, now we know she's in Diwakar's custody, why don't you make a move?
We didn't knew anything about her, so we had some hope, after knowing... ...it's better to forget about her.
Nobody can ever touch Diwakar.
He's no ordinary man.
I don't care who he is!
All I care is what he has done.
Kidnapping Deepthi is enough to show him hell.
KK brothers mean king of hell!
Prabhakar and Diwakar!
Show them hell is impossible.
Worst example of children growing into demons from a broken family.
Prabhakar and Diwakar are illegal children of their father.
Both ruling party and opposition party are their slaves.
Prabhakar is happy if people are afraid of him.
But Diwakar has a strange weakness.
Playing drama!
Even in real life he behaves like the villain roles he dons in dramas.
Does your old hands still have the same strength?
Was it these hands that signed to cancel our bus permits?
I'll now cut your hands into pieces.
Give your hands to me, Thakur!
He's a human beast who can tame a raging bull with empty hands.
Evil power!
He doesn't care about law or death.
To say clearly, he has no control on himself.
He behaves abnormally.
Though we know Deepthi is with him, it's not easy to free her from him.
Who is paying you salary?
Govt. or Diwakar?
You're licking his boots!
Show your police power on criminals not on innocents.
You may have your reasons, but it's my Deepthi who is with him,
I'll not care even if God of Death himself comes.
Why am I telling you this?
lnstead of doing a police job why not you better do...
I know how to bring back my Deepthi.
Don't become a criminal in the rush of blood.
You get back her if you kill him.
You may have to spend your life in jail.
Please don't spoil your future.
lf we fail to take action, call us whatever you want.
Just give us one chance to do our duty.
Home Minister!
How dare!
I made you the Home Minister, will you let your police come after me?
Hold on for just a minute, Prabhakar.
Don't raise your BP.
Somewhere a mistake has happened, how can police dare come to your home?
Are they here without your permission?
Don't narrate tales to me.
ln next elections my people will not vote for you, they will run buses over you.
Give the phone to the officer, I'll talk to him.
Who are you?
You?
What's this rashness?
Do you think yourself a police hero in uniform?
Sir, that is...
You must feel... that's the power of the uniform.
You're the first officer to there with a warrant.
Don't discuss like politician, bash those two bastards like policeman.
You do your duty, I'll not stop officers discharging their duty.
Don't show happiness on face, keep it sullen as if I'm scolding you.
Give the phone to that bastard!
Did you tell him?
- I told him clearly.
Just a formality, they'll see around your home and leave.
I'll take care of the later problems.
- Okay...okay.
It's locked!
Open it.
I can open it but you can't bear it.
You'll get scared seeing her pitiable condition.
Go...go and do your duty.
Open the door.
I'll not open it.
Do what so ever you want to!
Once I confirm who is inside, I'll do what ever I can then.
ls it the way to talk to an artiste because you've power?
I'm telling you, my girl is inside.
She's safe.
Write a report and leave.
Will you open it or shall I break it open?
Will you break it?- Yes.
- Let me see it.
Take their cell phones and break the wireless sets.
Bloody, take it down!
Go!
Study the sections and book the cases.
Go!
- We'll go.
We'll come back for you!
You're finished!
I've removed the chassis number and replaced it with fake.
Where?
How?
What happened sir?
ACP's jeep has met with an accident while coming from KK brothers' home.
ACP and all others with him are dead.
lf you covet another man's wife, you'll get ruined.
You'll pay dearly for your sins.
Experience!
What a lovely experience!
You're avoiding me without knowing the bliss in my arms.
Why are you so proud?
You're just a slave in the harem.
The only qualification you've is I desire you, if not what great qualification you have? may your husband be God, may your husbands be angels, holymen or Nagas or anything else, may they be ogres, demons or devils, but I'm mightiest of the mightiest Keechaka.
Don't know how much that demon is torturing my daughter.
He would've molested her, she would've lost her chastity.
Nothing will happen to Deepthi.
Chastity isn't a matter concerning body.
It's about the mind.
lf her body is hurt, a doctor can treat her back to health.
Her pure mind will be waiting for me only.
No need for the wife to commit adultery.
People desert wives purely on suspicion, though a father I'm not so broadminded, your grandfather was right, a man's true character comes out only during difficulties.
I know if you study well you can earn degrees,
I just came to know you become broadminded with culture.
One step further, I'll kill you, or else I'll kill myself.
You'll never get me.
- No...no...you must be safe.
Losing your life or mine is same.
Okay, if you're not in mood now, tomorrow...
lf not tomorrow, day after tomorrow...
Can't I wait for you?
lf it was for a night only, I would've had you by force.
I want all your nights for me, that's why I'm tolerating your abuses.
Take rest!
I'll bring Deepthi.
I'm not saying just as responsibility,
I'm saying it with love.
Not with laws or sections, one hit will bring down his evil empire.
My rage will not only make him cry save me, even his evil power will.
Who are you?
I came to introduce myself.
Show him our power, boys!
It's a week, you don't eat or drink, or even sleep.
Though lost weight, you're still beautiful.
I was expecting you'll give yourself to me.
lf not I always have the right to force.
I'll molest...
Still having hope that he'll come?
No phone calls, get out.
Prabhakar brother has used the word urgent for the first time in life.
Tell me, what's it?
- Brother, a man is here...
Not a man, say correctly.
Groom...Deepthi's groom.
It seems he's the groom.
You're nearing your death!
Leave her!
Leave Deepthi!
lf not your brother will die!
Yes, death has come very near.
Go!
Go!
Brother, don't leave her, kill him!
Brother, she made me remember that I'm a man.
Though you brought her for yourself, you have her first, then I'll have her.
Like we are partners in business, let's share her too.
Done?
Though Draupadi was won by Arjuna, all 5 brothers shared her.
Though I played so many dramas based on Mahabharata,
I forgot the basic concept of it.
Even Vali and Sugreeva did same in Ramayana.
You're dead, bloody!
How dare he teaches me epics about Vali and Sugreeva sharing a wife.
Doesn't he know Sugreeva planned and killed Vali?
Had you that common sense you'd be alive now, brother?
Will you leave your brother as orphan, brother?
Our father died in your hands, you died in my hands, why should I live now?
Why should I live?
I must live for her.
lf anyone else desires what I like, I'll not spare even if it's my own brother,
I'll kill him.
Till now you got saved hiding behind a woman like a eunuch,
I'll not give you a second chance,
Did you see how he jumped?
- He's mad man!
Poor man!
How long can he swim?
This is my domain!
It isn't a thrill to kill a lion in kitchen, but killing a deer in forest is very thrilling.
I like hunting before killing.
Start!
- Already started!
Your brother's body...
Let's finish him first and then cremate him leisurely.
I've only one enemy now.
lf my desire has to be fulfilled, I must offer a human sacrifice.
You didn't even tie the knot, what am I to you?
I don't know.
But I feel like giving my life for you.
You didn't go away, you came back for me.
That's enough for me.
Madam, anyone here?
Body is cool.
Looks like she has been starving for many days.
These tablets...
- Find her!
Find her if not Diwakar will crush all of us under his lorry.
Find her...what are you doing here?
Are Diwakar's men searching for her?
I beg you, if they see me, they will kill me.
Please leave the place with her.
Go away!
One minute!
This saline will keep her alive for sometime.
Take her to a hospital immediately.
Catch them!
What's this?
- Break them.
Ensure boss doesn't come here.
lf he sees this, either he'll kill himself or us.
Have they gulped adhesive to stick like that?
What else you want?
Run boys!
Girls are like this if they like a man, they will go any far.
Chastity isn't matter concerning body.
It's about mind.
I wanted to announce my choice.
I kissed you.
You know only that.
Your love has taken me to that far, with pure heart I've consummated our marriage in my imagination.
I don't care if anything happens to me now.
I don't know if I'll live with you all the life, just few moments with you is enough.
Search...find her!
Till now death was after us, now we are after death.
Bloody useless buggers!
Didn't find them?
- No.
Didn't find them?
- No, boss.
You must find them, if not you will die like him.
Will you die for me?
Even death can't separate us, right?
I'm ready.
Come out from your hallucinations!
You lived in dreams till now imagining yourself in roles.
I'm reality, standing right before you.
Do you've guts to face me?
You don't have guts that's why you kidnapped Deepthi from marriage.
I'll tie the knot with Deepthi in the same place where it was stopped,
lf you're a man dare stop it.
Try to take away Deepthi from me.
lf you don't have that guts... ...kill me right now here!
Before anyone dares touch me, I'll kill half of them before I die.
That is manliness!
Deepthi is ready to die for me.
That is love!
Nobody can stop a man or love.
lf you've the guts, if you're a man,
let's meet in the marriage.
He's like Lord Krishna ready to wage war as Sathyabhama drives the chariot.
You mean boss is demon Narakasura!
He's finished!
Team DG
I came at your call, do you've to step on threshold and close the door?
After winning the war, do you want to have you?
It's fun all the night...
I got your call...
When I call out to secluded place, don't stop liKe that...
Don't exhibit your prowess, it's a folK art...
Kiss from is mouth watering... if you say no how to I quench my thirst?
Boundary doesn't you must stop... no doesn't you've to postpone it...
Hot blossoming flower... may I pricKyou?
LiKe a wish if you want it as gift...
Don't let me shed my shyness by crossing boundaries of decency...
You're a swing of bliss... won't it maKe me crazy, my dear?
Don't Kill me with your romance... the maiden has waved the green flag...
I'm the mischievous lover boy, may I become yours?
Prabhakar has many followers.
Looking at them i feel they are not here to pay respects, there's something else.
What is it?
lf we know it earlier, how can he be Diwakar?
We can judge or stop an angry man, but a silent man is most dangerous.
lf you're a man, let's meet in the marriage.
I can't manage this alone for tomorrow's marriage.
Don't know who is doing what.
Hey fool!
Where are you taking bananas?
Keep it there.
Go.
Are you done with making laddus?
Will you please stop eating first?
Those girls are spoiling it, clean and keep it safely.
Why did you change your get up, Dilip Raja?
Not just get up, I've changed my mind set too.- ls it?
Marriage in town and dogs are barking.
Why are you so busy here?
Granny...
Your bucket is ready, will you kick it for fun?
I don't mind if you kick me, youth will feel if you kick my bucket.
What are you doing here?
You don't like such traditional marriages, right?
Why wouldn't I like it?
Entire state is waiting for this marriage.
I'll watch your marriage and change my attitude.
This marriage will go on smoothly, you don't worry, dad.
lf danger comes unexpected, you may not face it properly, if I invite danger on my own,
I know how to deal with it.
WalKing moon...lightning plait...
May she's JanaKi herself....
World will praise you couple...
If it blows you can meet, shine liKe sunray of summer...
Fairer than the fairest...
Can demand dowry for walK...
She's gentle liKe butterfly... bride is a treasure herself...
Groom is parrot...
Love is delivering today...
Hands full of grains... stealing moments of happiness...
Bashing beauty turned pinK... cheeKs turned red...
Untouched youth's bounty behind the raised hands...
With stealing glances young maiden's shyness is playing hide and seeK...
The hand coming to unite is lily plant...
Joining fingers is moonbeam...
Yearning eyes are petals of lotus...
When eyes meet it's sunbeam...
Evil power!
It's not great to take her when she belongs to no one, must take her when she's proud of becoming someone's wife.
That is manliness!
This is not property to usurp, this is bond of relationship.
My husband will reply for the insults heaped on me.
Like the third step of Vamana sent Bali into earth,
I walked 7 steps with my husband, his eight step will crush you.
Marriage is first step to keep this world clear from demons like you.
You said it right, dear.
Good marriage makes good couple
Good couple make good children
Good children make good society
Yes, good society makes good world
You're inciting me with your words.
I'm furious.
Not just with desire on you but anger too.
I'll go on honeymoon with your wife after killing you.
You're telling a lot about love.
Come, I'll bury your love.
The more you try to bury it, the more it gets entrenched.
ln heart!
Nobody can uproot it!
Are you challenging me for love?
lf you've guts, tear open my chest!
Come on!
Evil power!
Just because you've hands, you can't tie the knot, to protect your wife you need strength in your hands. you don't have that strength, why do you want love and marriage?
Come!
Our marriage shall be forever and ever.
Hey evil power!
Come up!
Evil power!
You've proved nothing can stop love.
You married her with love and saved the world from demon like him.
Darling of mother and parents' lucky charm...
As she leaves to her ln-laws place...
As she bids adieu to mother's place, parents are in tears of love...
The man who married is sea of love...
When those tears of love merge into the sea of love...
Affections are silently singing song of love...
They are as charming as romantic poems of Srinadha Kavi...
You're the wealth, welcome dear...
Fresh leaves...
You've got yourself a man like Lord Hari...
Lucky charm of mother's place....
Walk into ln-law's place with right leg...
I want to introduce one more problem that can be solved with search techniques. This is a sliding blocks puzzle, called a 15 puzzle. You may have seen something like this.
The 2nd heuristic, h2, is equal to the sum of the distances that each block would have to move to get to the right position. For this position, 10 would have to move 1 space to get to the right position, 11 would have to move 1, so that's a total of 2 so far, 13 is in the right place, 14 is 1 displaced, and 15 is 1 displaced, so that would also be a total of 4. Now, the question is:
The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate.
Now rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin, and then to Mars ... (Laughter) ... if we use pennies. Now this is obviously a powerful, some might say dangerously powerful, insight. But it's also a morally important one.
And some people think that string theory is tough. (Laughter) Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.
Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. And it was a big Christmas hit. Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.

The answer is that breadth-first search is complete, so even if the tree is infinite, if the goal is placed at any finite level, eventually, we're going to march down and find that goal. Same with cheapest first. No matter where the goal is, if it has a finite cost, eventually, we're going to go down and find it.

What I wanna do in this video is get ourselves a little bit more comfortable with the idea of strings.
And also see the power of strings, and all the things we can do to them. or do with them.
I'm gonna write a little simple program that will essentially just define a bunch of strings for me. And then I'm gonna use the Python interpreter to play with those strings and see what we can do to them.
So let me define a string. Let's call the string "a" and "a" is—
As you know, a string is just a big sequence of characters right over here and you could recognize them because they'll either be in single or double quotation marks (' or ").
If you want to get rid of a task that you accidentally assigned to yourself, first, click on My tasks, to see your own tasks.
If you hover over the task, you will see a Decline option appear.
If you click on that, the task disappears.
This next optimization problem that I've been sent seems fun. I've actually never seen this problem before, and so I'm even more excited to do it. So it says, a wire of length 100 centimeters is cut into two pieces.
Could be 100 miles long. And we're going to cut it at some point. We'll cut it there.
[Male narrator] The answer is that we add 1 more path, the path to Bucharest. We don't add the path going back because it's in the explored list, but we don't terminate it yet.
Many people take their lives every day because of this taboo. The Bible is a very dangerous text.
In the FPÖ [Austrian populist party] they said that homosexuality is a culture of death. If it's not possible to sacrifice just a little bit of tradition in order to give teenagers the feeling that they live in a less threatening environment and they can therefore avoid taking their own lives, then you can not really talk about loving your neighbour. The Bible is a very dangerous text.
Of the 3 paths on the frontier, we have ones with a cost of 146, 140, and 118. And that's the cheapest, so this one gets expanded. We take it off the frontier, move it to explored, add in its successors.
And this path for a total cost of 239. And now the question is, which path do we expand next?
Welcome to the presentation on BASlC ADDlTION. I know what you're thinking:
"Sal, addition doesn't seem so basic to me." Well, I apologize. I hope I --
What is 3 + 4? Hmm. This is, I think, a more difficult problem.
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 avocados. So 3 + 4 is equal to 7. And now I am going to introduce you to another way of thinking about this.
8 + 1 is just the next number [after 8]. But if you look at the number line, you start at 8, and you add 1.
8 + 1 is equal to 9. Let's do some harder problems.
And, just so you know, if you're a little daunted by this initially, you can always draw the circles, you can always do the number line, and, eventually over time, the more practice you do, you'll hopefully memorize these, and you'll do these problems in, like, half a second. I promise you. You've just got to keep practicing.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 So let's do a hard problem. What is --
5 + 6 So if you want, you can pause the video and try this. You might already know the answer.
So we start at the 5. And we're gonna add 6 to it. So we go:
What is 6 + 5? Huh... Well, we're now going to see that, OK?
So let's start at 6. Right? Ignore the yellow for now and add 5 to it.
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5. Ah. We get to the same place.
"5 + 6" is the same thing as "6 + 5." And that makes sense. If I have 5 avocados and you give me 6,
What is -- What is 8 + 7? Well, if you can still read this, 8 is right here. Right?
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... 6 ... 7. We go to 15. 8 + 7 is 15.
If you don't know the answer to any of the addition problems, that we give you in the exercises, you can press the "Hints," and it'll draw circles, and then you can just count up the circles. Or, if you want to do it on your own, so you get the problem right, you could draw the circles, or you could draw a number line, -- like we did in this presentation.
Let's try to understand a little better how uniform cost search works. We start at a start state, and then we start expanding out from there looking at different paths, and what we end of doing is expanding in terms of contours like on a topological map, where first we span out to a certain distance, then to a farther distance, and then to a farther distance. Now at some point we meet up with a goal.
Let's say we have the indefinite integral of the square root of 6x minus x squared minus 5. And obviously this is not some simple integral. I don't have just, you know, this expression and its derivative lying around, so u-substitution won't work.
Here we give you an intuition as to why an optimistic heuristic function, h, finds the lowest-cost path. When A-star ends, it returns a path, p, with estimated cost, c. It turns out that c is also the actual cost, because at the goal the h component is 0, and so the path cost is the total cost as estimated by the function.
If h is optimistic, then the estimated cost is less than the true cost, so the path p must have a cost that's less than the true cost of any of the paths on the front tier. Any paths that go beyond the front tier must have a cost that's greater than that because we agree that the step cost is always 0 or more. So that means that this path, p, must be the minimal cost path.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries. Now I work in the solar technology industry. And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing. It's just a quick video of what we do. Huh.
(Laughter)
(Music)
This is not ...
(Laughter) Okay.
(Laughter) Solar technology is ... Oh, that's all my time?
(Applause)
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago. And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate. No biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being. Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
(Laughter) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind.
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies. In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun.
That's why the Voodooists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God. We dance in the temple and become God." And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed?
(Laughter) It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality. In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s --
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts? Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error," which is exposed to be meaningless. But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants. I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No." Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.
156 nations carry our television channel. Our magazines are read by millions. And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being.
(Applause)
Have you ever heard the sound of frogs calling at night? For hundreds of millions of years, this croaking lullaby has filled the nighttime air. But recent studies suggest that these frogs are in danger of playing their final note.
The answer is: these 2 characters here appear only in these 2 locations corresponding to the words corn cream which appear only in these locations in the English text. Again, we're not 100% sure that's the right answer, but it looks like a strong correlation. Now, 1 more question.

Inside drives me blind with one look from you Hi Dad. Hi son, you're here.
(applause) Hi honey. What is wrong? You look worried.
My mother died because of this shit and rest of the stuff, you know? I can't deal with this, you know? Mom told me, I never told you this, but Mom told me before when I was a kid.
You don't just retire. You don't just get out of this, just say "I'm done and that's it." It doesn't work like that. That's why I don't want to jump in.
Dad. I'm just gonna run away from Russia, just go somewhere and start a new life. Hopefully nobody is gonna find me somewhere and I'm gonna be happy and not hear again about this Mafia thing.
I'I walk from here. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
Mrs Marshal.
Mom, this is Ivan. Oh, Hi Ivan. Welcome to America.
Demitry, is jake. Yeah.
LA. I know. I understand Sir.
No man, I'm the only son. My mom died when I was ten. My dad has his own crazy business and I'm not into supporting so I kinda of walked away.
Is my first day in LA, in United States, It's cool. I'm glad that I understand you guys. If I would start speaking Russian, nobody would probably understand anything.
Is not about that. After my mom died, I missed love. It was not enough love from my dad, he was always busy and that kind of stuff, so.
That's sad. ha ha ha ha Dude she is hot! That's crazy! He is one lucky son of a gun, that's all I know.
I would like to take you out. Tomorrow, at 11. That is perfect.
Well, I don't know how that involves me, so find Ivan yourself. Look, Ivan's problem can become your problem, real quick. We need to really help him now.
Demitry, welcome to the States! Don't screw around. This guy is crazy.
Wakey, wakee. Do you know who we are. Do you know what we're doing here.
Demitry! I tried to save you kid but you don't want to listen. Just let me go.
I'e got the person that I will spend my life with it. Well, we are both young and hopefully we will get along together well, because we need more experience. But I'm so happy to be here, I have only you here.
I'm gonna pray to God that our marriage is gonna last forever and we are going to spend to death and die in the same day. Wow! I hope so too, in the dame day!
I'm out. Demitry, What did you got? Full house.
Demitry, a little bit more poker won't kill you. A little bit? We're playing for one or two hours!
What else we're gonna do? We have people to kill. Let't get to work.
Tony!

Find the total distance traveled by the particle over the time interval between time t = 0 and t = 3, or 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 3.
Let's learn a little bit about the gradient, and we'll use the same function we've been using since we're pretty familiar with it's graph and it's partial derivatives. So let's say that f of x y is equal to x squared plus x times y plus y squared. Now we're going to take the gradient of this, and then I'll give you a little bit of intuition on what a gradient is.
Now we've had an introduction to Al. We've heard about some of the properties of environments, and we've seen some possible architecture for agents. I'd like next to show you some examples of AI in practice.
And Sebastian and I have some experience personally in things we have done at Google, at NASA, and at Stanford. And I want to tell you a little bit about some of those.
One of the best successes of AI technology at Google has been the machine translation system. Here we see an example of an article in Italian automatically translated into English. Now, these systems are built for 50 different languages, and we can translate from any of the languages into any of the other languages.
1 year ago Home isn't the same without you Hey Dad, at the apartment now.
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family.
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money. Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do." And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.
TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. I figured, they're not workaholics.
(Laughter) Good!
(Applause) Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it." There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.
"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing." And push! David Gallo says, "Push yourself.
"My mother pushed me." (Laughter) Serve!
"OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich." Ideas!
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company." I'd say it was a pretty good idea. And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things.
"Persistence is the number one reason for our success." You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap!
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews! (Applause)

(Lakshmi Pratury)This session is going to be a little different because, Mansukhbhai wants to speak in hindi. So, we're going to have a little conversation. And I will do the best to translate it.
(LP) So, he's saying, he made this machine, instead of making 100 in a (day), the machine started making 600 pans a day. So, most of the people were interested in buying the machine. So, he invented that.
(To Mansukhbhai) So, tell us more about this (MP) The clay pot that we used to make could be used only to fill normal water so I thought that, the big people, those with money they can, (laughs) afford to drink water from the water filter. but for the poor people how can they afford a water filter? So then I made with my own hands a 0.9 micron candle out of clay through which water would be filtered and clean water would come. The bacteria that is needed for us to be healthy we recieve through this water filter, and the bacteria that are not needed those that are bigger than 1 micron, get filtered.
(To Mansukhbhai) So, what is this, tell us?
(Mansukhbhai) The utensils that we make, the pots that we make, when in 2001 there was an earthquake in Gujarat due to the earthquake, all of the pots broke. Our nearby local news reporter wrote, that the poor people lost their fridge. So then I thought that the pot which is a fridge for the poor the poor also have dreams about having a fridge in their homes, they would feel good about it. but they don't have the money to buy a fridge.
(MP) After this, the normal frying pan that we used to make I added a non-stick coating to it poor people can fulfil their needs through this they can also have a non-stick frying pan in their houses. When I started this in 2005
(To Mansukhbhai) So now you have innovated so much- now what more do you wish to do?
(MP) Now,in clay the things that I have told you about the innovations that I have done have been featured in Forbes our fridge, our cooker, our frying pan and our filter have all been featured. I have recieved the Presidential (Rashtrapati) award as well So now we have thought of doing something new with clay, we have thought of a new idea

"Write a mathematical expression which corresponds to x time y minus a times b times c."
I could either write that as x × y, or I could just write that as xy.
And from that, I'm going to subtract a times b times c. So: minus a times ... And I could write it a [asterisk] b [asterisk] c.
I could write it like that.
Or I could just write -abc.
And you can see how it's being interpreted by the computer right over here. It understands that I'm saying x times y minus a times b times c (or xy - abc).
And I'm done.

[Thrun] The correct answer is intelligent agent. Let's talk about intelligent agents.
Welcome to Part 2 on the presentation on Level 1 exponent rules. So let's start off by reviewing the rules we've learned already. If I had 2 to the tenth times 2 to the fifth, we learned that since we're multiplying exponents with the same base, we can add the exponent, so this equals 2 to the fifteenth.
A* Search works by always expanding the path that has a minimum value of the function f which is defined as a sum of the g + h components.
The answer is this one. Two-twenty is less than 229 or 239. Take it off the frontier.
Add in 2 more paths and sum them up. So, 220 plus 146 is 366. And 220 plus 97 is 317.
[Narrator] Now let's define a function for solving problems. It's called Tree Search because it superimposes a search tree over the state space.
Now in this case all 3 paths have the same length, length 1, so we break the tie at random or using some other technique, and let's suppose that in this case we choose this path from Arad to Sibiu. Now the question I want you to answer is once we remove that from the frontier, what paths are we going to add next? So show me by checking off the cities that ends the paths, which paths are going to be added to the frontier?
we're used to seeing things from a particular point of view that is from a particular frame of reference and things look different to us under different circumstances at the moment
you look to queue here you're upside down you're the ones upside down no europe turns out well not he's the one that's upside down his name well let's talk for a
hi you lose people want to really up that that you better come into my frame of reference now
frame of reference was inverted from what it usually is that view of things would be normal for me if i normally walk to my friends this represents a frame of reference just three route that together so that peace is at right angles to the other two now i'm going to move in this direction if either plane at the same spot on your screen but you know i'm moving that way because you see the wall moving that way behind me but how do you know that i'm not that i think bill and the wall moving workable now the wallet that the pier and you have no way of telling whether imovie or not but now you know that i'm moving the point of it is that all motions it's relative in both cases i was moving relative to the wall and the wall with moving relative to me all motion is relative but we tend to think of one thing is being fixed and the other thing has been moving we usually think of the earth inspect and walls are usually pick to beer so perhaps you were the part of the first time when it was the wallet was moving and not doctor whom a frame of reference text of the earth is the most common frame of reference in which to observe the motion of other things that is the frame of reference that you're used to the framers baton to the table the table is bolted to the floor the florida anchored in the building and the building at firmly attached to the earth of course the reason for having three rods if the position uh... any object such as this fall can be specified using these three reference line this reference line points in the direction which we called up two different directions here than it is on the other side of the air and these two reference lines specify a plane which we call horizontal or level in this film we're going to look at the motion of object in this third frame of reference and other frames of reference moving in different ways relative to the other frame well let's look at a motion this field ball can be held are by the electra mode no i'm going to open the switch and you watch the motions of the ball the ball is accelerated straight down by gravity along the line parallel to this vertical reference blood as you can see the electromagnetic mounted on the cockpit can move i'm going to do exactly the same experiment the doc resume did but this time while a cart is moving at a constant velocity is pulled along by spring which is longer on this photograph turntable and that hold that with a constant velocity when the car passes this line be lol this week that you can see i'm going to start the cart down at the end of the table so that by the time it gets to this point by can be sure it's moving with a constant velocity i want you to watch right here so that you will see the ball falling
i think you can see that the ball landed in exactly the same position of the did before when doctor whom did the experiment with the car text but this time the ball could not have fallen straight down let me show you off the ball was released at that point if it had fallen straight down because the cart moves on in the time to take the fall would have landed back here somewhere but it didn't wanted to do the experiment again best time i'm going to let you watch the motion through slow-motion camera which is fixed the cart moves by the ball will fall and you can watch a missile which the camera
how true this again first-time there'll be a line on the film so if you can see the fat repeatedly complete but the problem all to the ground all of this has been in a frame of reference fixed to the year all of this motion locked in a frame of reference which was moving along with the car frame of reference like that well so that you can see what it looks like i'm going through solution camera so that it was with the car permittivity experiment again incidently i started and the number to stand here when the ball for all of you will have something which is fixed as a reference point
in their moving frame of reference i think you can see but the problem all as a political straight line it looks exactly the same as the day before when doctor whom did the experiment with the car etc if we were moving along in this frame of reference and we couldn't see the surroundings then we wouldn't be able to tell by this experiment that we were moving at a constant velocity as a matter of fact we wouldn't be able to tell by any experiment that we were moving at a constant velocity i'm gonna do the experiment once more and this time i'm not going to stand here behind the ball at the fall so that you won't have any fixed repertoire
as far as you're concerned that time the karke wasn't necessarily moving at all that time when you couldn't see the background then i think perhaps it was harder for you to realize that you were in moving frame of reference important thing to realize here all frames of reference moving at constant velocity with respect to one another are equivalent doctor ivy showed you but the motion of the ball that was released from the moving karte looked like in the current frame of reference and in the car frame the motion looks simpler from a car now i want you to watch the motion white spot would probably be the clock moving out circle
but that is what it's practiced actually like in the hurt of reference this is your normal frame of reference you father thought moving in the circle because you're high moved along with the car you put yourself in the frame of reference of the moving truck so if it isn't always true that we view motion from the third frame of reference when the motion is simpler from the moving frame you automatically put yourself and not moving frame now we're going to do another experiment on a relative motion to show how the compare the block today of an object in one printer records to explore all serbian another frame of reference forgiveness drive a spark a certain stark it moves a straight across the table with a speed which is essentially constant because the forces of friction of the made very small this is just the law of inertia an object moves the constant velocity unless an unbalanced force acts on it how you get the same start backwards uh... dougherty and gives it the same started moves back in this direction with the same philosophy now we're on a car here a car which can move in which were you going to move in this direction and we're going to repeat the experiment all right let's go
if we were making measurements here then we would observe the same but lots of these that is the same experimental results that we did before and so would you because you are observing this experiment through with the camera which is fast into this car added you were in the moving frame of reference but now we're going to do the experiment again and this time you watched through a camera which is fixed in the poor frame of reference or concentrate on watching the clock to lecture i follow us i think you'll see that in a move faster that way and not so bad this way relative to u_n_ relative to the wall husband
here the car which was moving along in this direction with the velocity we were thinking on the card at a table here i am over on the side and uh... doctor doom was on the side and we were pushing back-and-forth on the table well i pushed it and went into this direction with the velocity v when doctor didn't want to do when in this direction the same velocity v but this is the velocity relative to the car what about the velocity relative to an observer on the ground in the picture brain well if it was pushed in this direction it's velocity to you plot being if it's in this direction it will also be used u minded b this is all very reasonable is nothing very hard to understand here the surprising thing about this expression is that it is not actor in all circumstances at very high speed by high speed i mean speeds close to the velocity of light expression breakdown at these very high speed we have to use the ideas about relative motion developed by a albert einstein in his special theory of relativity for all the speed of the we're ever likely to run into this expression you plus or minus the is completely adequate so far we've been talking about frames of reference moving at a constant velocity relative to one another now i'm going to do the experiment with the dropping ball again only that time the karte will be accelerated relative to the earth frame these weight will fall and give the cart a constant acceleration first of all out and then i'll really put the motion is very fast and i want you to watch at the point where the ball is released from the pic camera i don't know whether you thought that are not at the top of the vault with the things that was before for either prime it landed in a different spots this is because the cart kept on accelerating in this direction as the ball was falling now i'm going to let you see it again with the slow-motion camera fixed on to the car
this time you saw the bull moving off to one side falling down the vertical reference line as it did in the constant velocity case but suppose you were in the six telerate a frame of reference how could you explain this gravity is the only force acting on this fall so it should fall straight down but at the law of inertia is to hold there must be a farce pushing sideways on the ball in this direction accorded to deviate from the vertical path but what kind of a force is it it is not gravitational or an electric or nuclear force in fact it is in the force at all as we know what story left to conclude but it gets sensor is no force that could be pushing in this direction on the ball but the law governorship just does not hold this is a strange frame of reference we call a frame of reference in which the law of inertia holes and inertial the law how the nurse or holds in the third frame of reference so it is an inertial frame the car moving at constant velocity relative to the earth is an inertial frame but the car which is expel a rated is not an inertial frame because the frame of reference that we're used to living in is one in which the law of inertia holds when we go into a non inertial like the frame of the accelerated car our belief in the lava nurture is so strong but when we feed them acceleration of the ball sideways we think there is a port carpet so we make fiction but they're into force and sometimes we call this fictitious force fictitious forces arise an accelerated frames of reference the frame is accelerated in this direction so you in the frame cn acceleration of the ball in this direction and you say that there is a force cutting it
what's happening this time why doesn't the talking straight across the table i did it before how you can see it doesn't if we believe in the law of inertia but we must believe that there is an unbalanced force to change the velocity of the pot but this pope is nearly friction locks so what can be exerting this unbalanced correspondent though that you watched the motion this time through a camera which is fixed in the earth's frame of reference
i think if you concentrate on watching dot papa you can't be that it is a warning is a great time and that therefore there is no i'm not quite acting on it
now we're going to stop this rotation but i can talk to you about what is happening here i don't know about you but i'm busy in d fixed fame of reference there was no one balanced force within the frame of reference for taking in this turntable there was and unbalanced because the velocity kept changing was with the fictitious part rotating plane is unknown inertial or accelerated fame just as the accelerated frame of the karte the doctor humes showed you you know that every object which is moving in a circle has an acceleration toward the center of the circle this is the exploration of has a special namely and capital acceleration now you will this puck for a while workstudy while the turntable is rotating i'll get off theoretic i'm ready but the rotation
you concede that now the park isn't moving in a circle dr humans exerting a force to keep it moving in the circle and you can see this from the fact that the rubber ring is extended heat is exerting the center of the billboards and this is the only horizontal force acting on the part but not let's look at it again from his point of view in the rotating system he is exerting a force towards the center of the table and yet the puck is standing still produced more or less taylor some vibration how he believes in a lot of inertia so he thinks there's and equal parts on the part away from the center of the table so that there is no unbalanced boring this outward force in the pocket the fictitious sports in this case sometimes it's called the centrifugal force in the pics reference frame there is no award boris on the path now suppose the doctor doom stops exerting a barge watch the pot in the picture frame of reference the puck moves off in a straight line there's no no unbalanced boris acting on it now let's look at it again from his point of view in the rotating system when he releases the proc which to him was everest it mood the force away from the sender is now on unbalanced part on the talked to him the outward course on the part is fictitious in our food frame of reference it doesn't think that's but the doctor whom in the accelerated frame of reference it's a perfectly real force i hope by now doctor i do not have convinced you the rotating frame of reference is not in their shel frame for you've all been told that the hurt it's rotating abode of taxes and that also it travels in a nearly circular orbit around the time why then do we find in a frame of reference attached securely to the earth but the law of inertia seems to hold why don't we observed fictitious forces the five of the fictitious forces which we have to introduce in a non initial frame depends upon the acceleration of the frame these smaller the acceleration is v smaller the fictitious forces that we introduced here's a frame of reference attached to the equator of the car the acceleration of this frame is really very small because bearded spinning about it axis it has an acceleration directly inward app three d_ one hundred of a major per second square on they one kilogram at the equator their is the fictitious for us directly upwards out three one hundred but this is not by gravity which is a port downward of nine point eight new so the net downward force is smaller than that of gravity alone if i've dropped av one kilogram at the equator the acceleration would be slightly smaller than that due to gravity alone very much now the acceleration of the car in its orbit is even smaller still and produces even smaller affect in our frame of reference mike said that the earth was rotating abode faxes how do we know but this is slow well if you take a time exposure photograph of the stars they seem to be moving in circles a both p pole star but all motion is relative is there any way of telling which is moving or the stars the fact that it is because which is rotating can be demonstrated by means of the pendulum if i've got a pendulum swinging its wings back-and-forth in a plane though it turns out is this pendulum with the north pole of the art the plane of swing would remain fixed relative to the stars but would rotate relative now i'll have to show you what i need this pendulum is epicenter how this turntable which will represent europe no i was about the cable turning around in this direction i'll put a black arrow on so that you'll remember but the rotation the pendulum is that the north pole of the earth annuals motion as you ordinarily do standing on the earth the playing of swing rotates in the opposite direction from the rotation of the turntable and that exactly the same rate now look at it from the fixed cabral which will represent the frame of the stars the turntable the alert rotate but the plane of the pendulum remain specs a pendulum used for this purpose because approval pendulum use tommy dot wong at the beginning of this film
My mom took me to my grandmother's home and told her to take care of me. They treated me like a maid. So then I decided to run away from my home at the age of eleven,
"Are you coming for home?" and I would just tell them my story. After that I started to work with them at the New Delhi railway station. I am a ragpicker there, I used to collect water bottles and refill them to sell for Rs.5 in general train compartments (bogies)
After 6 months, I didn't have any income because every platform had a villain and they would take all my money. Then I decided to go find some other work, I ran away because I wanted to travel a lot.
After that, Meera Nair had made a movie called "Salaam Bombay" in 1988 after its success, she started an NGO called "Salaam Balak Trust" A volunteer picked me from that restaurant(dhaba) and sent me to Salaam Balak Trust and I started to study there.
When I was in 10th standard, my percentage was very less, 48%. So then my teacher told me, "You're not very good at studying- so you change your track and you do something else." So then I thought if I do photography then I will be able to travel.
I asked him, "How do you become a professional photographer when- your English is not good? What should I do" Dixie told me that, "There are a lot of Japanese and Chinese photographers- that can't speak in English but they are good photographers- you are Indian so you can speak in Hindi."
So I started to assist him and in 2007 I did my first solo show, that was called "Street Dreams." When I was on the streets, I had some dreams So I chose under 18 years of age kids.
(Applause) After that I went to the U.S.A for 6 months, where I started studying in ICP (International Center of Photography) They also gave me an opportunity to take photographs of the re-construction of the World Trade Center every week, one day for 2 hours.
So then we e-mailed Dayanita Singh, saying "Ma'am we want to open a photography library,- can you donate your book?" She read our concept and she liked it. She said, "I will come and definitely give my book."

We've seen what search can do for problem solving. It can find the lowest-cost path to a goal, and it can do that in a way in which we never generate more paths than we have to. We can find the optimal number of paths to generate, and we can do that with a heuristic function that we generate on our own by relaxing the existing problem definition.
[Problem solving works when:] Problem-solving technology works when the following set of conditions is true: First, the domain must be fully observable.
The answer is that we're not done yet, because the algorithm works by doing the goal test, when we take a path off the front tier, not when we put a path on the front tier. Instead, we just continue in the normal way and choose the node on the front tier which has the lowest value.
That would be this one--the path through Pitesti, with a total of 417.
Now we expand Fagaras and we get a path that reaches the goal and it has a path length of 450 and an estimated distance of 0 for a total f value of 450, and now the question is: What do we do next? Click here if you think we're at the end of the algorithm and we don't need to expand next or click on the node that you think we will expand next.
